# Error responses

All Flexprice API errors follow a consistent structure. Each error response includes:

- `success`: Boolean flag indicating whether the request was successful (always `false` for errors)
- `error`: Object containing error details with:
  - `message`: Human-readable description of the error
  - `internal_error`: Internal error details (may be empty for client errors)

Error responses may also include additional fields specific to the error type.

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Could not find a resource of type Plan with identifier: DBhwNcMNfYgeBpn.",
    "internal_error": ""
  }
}
```

## Common error types

The table below lists common error types. When processing errors programmatically, use the HTTP status code along with the error message.

| Resource conflict           | 409         | Returned when the request conflicts with another concurrent request. This may occur when multiple requests attempt to modify the same resource simultaneously (e.g., the credits ledger). You can safely retry these requests. |
