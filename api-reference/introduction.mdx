# Welcome to the FlexPrice API

The FlexPrice API enables you to programmatically manage pricing, subscriptions, and billing for your SaaS application. This documentation will help you integrate FlexPrice into your application.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```plaintext
https://api.cloud.flexprice.io/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API Key or JWT token.

#### JWT Token:
These are the tokens you get when you login to the FlexPrice Dashboard.
These tokens are short lived and can be used to authenticate requests to the API.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

#### API Key:
These are the keys you get when you create a new API key in the FlexPrice Dashboard.
These keys are long lived and can be used to authenticate requests to the API.
```bash
x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

Drop us an email at support@flexprice.io if you need help getting an API key.
