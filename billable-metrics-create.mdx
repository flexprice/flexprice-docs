title: "Creating a billable metric"

* At the top-right of the **Billable Metrics** dashboard, select **Add Meter** to create a new Billable Metric.

* **Define Event Schema**
  ![](/Screenshot2025-01-20at11.13.29PM.png)

  * **Event Name**

    * This is the **unique identifier** you’ll use to send events that match the metric.

    * Keep it **short and descriptive**—for example, `tokens_used` or `orders_placed`.

    * Must be unique across your Flexprice account to avoid confusion with other metrics.

  * **Display Name**:

    * It is a **user-friendly label** (e.g., “Tokens Used” or “Orders Placed”) that will appear on invoices, internal dashboards, and usage reports.

  * This helps you and your team instantly recognize what the metric measures—especially handy if you have several metrics.

**Example**
Suppose you want to track how many tokens users consume while calling your AI model. In that case:

* **Event Name**: `tokens_used`

* **Display Name**: `Tokens Used`

1. **Event Filters** *(Optional)*&#x20;
   ![](/Screenshot2025-01-20at11.25.02PM.png)
   Filters let you **narrow down** which events get counted or summed in this metric. You **do not** have to add filters if you want to aggregate **all** events of a given type. However, filters become crucial if you need more granular control, such as **billing for only certain AI models** or **distinguishing usage by environment**.

   * **Key & Values**

     * A filter consists of a **property key** (e.g., `model`) and **one or more values** (e.g., `llama3.1`, `llama3.2`).

     * Only events that match *both* the key and one of the values are included in the metric.

It is important to note that filters cannot be edited later, so decide up front if you’ll need them for billing or reporting.

**Example**
Continuing our AI tokens example:
If your system supports multiple AI models (`llama3.1`, `llama3.2`, `alpaca2.0`), and you only want to track usage from **Llama** models for specialized billing, you can add a filter:

* **Key**: `model`

* **Values**: `llama3.1`, `llama3.2`

This means Flexprice will only aggregate token usage events where `model` is either `llama3.1` or `llama3.2`.

1. **Define Aggregation**
   The **aggregation** settings tell Flexprice **how** to measure your events.

   * **Aggregation**

     * Common options include **SUM** or **COUNT**.

     * **SUM**: Adds a numeric property (like tokens, price, etc.) across all matching events.

     * **COUNT**: Counts the total number of matching events, regardless of any numeric value in the event data.

   * **Aggregation Value**

     * The **property** that Flexprice sums or evaluates. For `SUM`, this property should be numeric (e.g., `tokens`).

     * If you choose **COUNT**, you typically don’t specify a numeric property (because you’re just counting occurrences).

   * **Aggregation Type**

     * **Cumulative**: The meter never resets. Usage keeps accumulating across billing cycles, providing a running total. This is useful for features like storage.

     * **Periodic**: Usage resets at each **billing period** (e.g., monthly). This is ideal for most subscription-based models where usage is calculated anew every cycle

**Example**
If you’re summing the total tokens used:

* **Aggregation** = `SUM`

* **Aggregation Value** = `tokens`

* **Aggregation Type** = `Periodic` (if you invoice monthly and want usage to reset each month)

**Save the Meter**

* Click **Save Meter** to finalize your settings.

* The Billable Metric becomes **Active** and appears on the dashboard.

You can now **send events** matching this **Event Name** (and any defined filters) to Flexprice. The system will immediately begin **aggregating** usage for billing and reporting.
