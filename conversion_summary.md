# Conversion Summary


## Conversion Process

1. Cleaned target directories
2. Converted Notion export to MDX format
3. Verified MDX files
4. Updated mint.json
5. Fixed import paths for Callout components
6. Created a custom Callout component for Mintlify
7. Removed Notion IDs from file and directory names
8. Fixed image references in MDX files
9. Updated image paths to use the /public prefix and URL encoding
10. Created a proper Callout component in the components directory
11. Fixed API reference warnings in mint.json

## Verification Results

All MDX files passed verification:
- Total MDX files: 36
- Files with issues: 0
- Files without frontmatter: 0
- Files without title: 0
- Files without description: 0
- Files with .mdx links: 0
- Files with import statements in frontmatter: 0
- Files with image path issues: 0

## Directory Structure

After conversion, the directory structure is:

- `docs/`: Contains the MDX files with a clean, nested structure
- `public/images/docs/`: Contains the images organized by section
- `components/`: Contains custom components for Mintlify
- `mint.json`: Configuration file for Mintlify with updated navigation

## Scripts Created

1. `convert_notion_to_mdx.py`: Converts Notion-exported Markdown files to MDX format
2. `update_mint_json.py`: Updates the `mint.json` file to reflect the new structure
3. `verify_mdx_files.py`: Verifies that the MDX files meet the required standards
4. `run_conversion.py`: Runs the entire conversion process
5. `clean_filenames.py`: Removes Notion IDs from file and directory names
6. `fix_image_paths.py`: Fixes image references in MDX files
7. `fix_image_paths_public.py`: Updates image paths to use the /public prefix and URL encoding
8. `fix_callout_imports.py`: Updates Callout component imports to use the correct path

## Next Steps

1. Review the MDX files in the `docs` directory
2. Check that images are correctly displayed
3. Test the documentation with Mintlify
4. Make any necessary adjustments

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the documentation:

1. Check that all image paths are correct and use the format `/public/images/docs/...` with URL encoding for spaces
2. Verify that the Callout component is properly imported from `../components/Callout`
3. Ensure that the navigation in `mint.json` matches the actual file structure
4. Run `npx mintlify dev` to test the documentation locally
