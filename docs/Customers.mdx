# Customers

A **Customer** in Flexprice represents a business or individual that subscribes to your plans and is billed for usage. Each customer is uniquely identified and can be assigned to specific pricing plans and entitlements.

**Why Manage Customers in Flexprice?**

- **Track subscriptions**: Associate customers with specific plans and features.
- **Automate billing**: Generate invoices based on usage.
- **Manage entitlements**: Control feature access at an individual level.
- **Analyze usage**: Monitor consumption for better insights.

Customers can be created manually in the dashboard or through API calls for automation.
