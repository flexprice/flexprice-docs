title: "Archive a customer"
---

As businesses evolve, some customers may become inactive due to churn, contract expiration, or strategic decisions. Instead of permanently deleting customer data, archiving allows you to preserve historical records while preventing further transactions or modifications. This ensures compliance with data retention policies while keeping your active customer list clean and manageable.

**Steps to archive a customer**

* Click on **Customers** to view the list of registered customers.

* Click on the three-dot menu next to the customer you want to archive

* Click **Archive** to proceed, or **Cancel** if you change your mind.

Please note:

* **No New Transactions**: The customer can no longer be billed or invoiced.

* **Existing Subscriptions End After the Current Cycle**: Any ongoing subscriptions will continue until the end of the current billing period and will not renew.

* **Data Retention**: Customer details, invoices, and payment history remain accessible for reporting purposes.
