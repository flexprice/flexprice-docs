# Event Ingestion

Event ingestion is the core mechanism that powers Flexprice's metered billing system. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the complete process of setting up usage tracking, sending events, and connecting them to billing.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers everything you need to know about event ingestion in Flexprice:

- **Creating Metered Features** - Define what you want to track and how to aggregate usage
- **Sending Events** - Learn the API structure and best practices for sending usage data
- **Validating Events** - Verify that events are being processed correctly
- **Connecting to Billing** - Turn usage into actual invoices and revenue

## Quick Start

If you're new to event ingestion, follow these steps in order:

1. **[Overview](Event%20Ingestion/Overview.md)** - Understand the core concepts
2. **[Creating a Metered Feature](Event%20Ingestion/Creating%20a%20metered%20feature.md)** - Set up what you want to track
3. **[Sending Events](Event%20Ingestion/Sending%20events.md)** - Learn how to send usage data
4. **[Validating Events](Event%20Ingestion/Validating%20events.md)** - Ensure events are working correctly
5. **[Connecting to Billing](Event%20Ingestion/Connecting%20to%20billing.md)** - Turn usage into invoices

## Core Concepts

### Event

A JSON payload containing usage information that your application sends to Flexprice.

### Feature

A definition of what you want to track (e.g., "API calls", "storage usage", "credits consumed").

### Aggregation

How Flexprice combines multiple events into a single quantity for billing. Supports following types: COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT UNIQUE, LATEST, SUM WITH MULTIPLIER, MAX, and WEIGHTED SUM.

### Plan

A pricing structure that defines how much to charge for feature usage.

### Subscription

A customer's enrollment in a plan, which generates invoices based on usage.

## Common Use Cases

- **API Usage** - Track API calls, requests, or tokens consumed
- **Storage** - Monitor file storage, database usage, or bandwidth
- **AI/ML** - Count model inferences, training hours, or data processed
- **User Activity** - Track logins, feature usage, or time spent
- **Compute Resources** - Monitor CPU time, memory usage, or GPU hours

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's how the entire process works:

1. **Create Feature**: Define "Model Usage" with Sum aggregation of "credits"
2. **Send Events**: Your app sends events with `"credits": 2`
3. **Validate**: Check that events appear in the dashboard
4. **Create Plan**: Set pricing at $1.00 per credit
5. **Subscribe Customer**: Assign the plan to a customer
6. **Generate Invoice**: Flexprice automatically calculates charges
