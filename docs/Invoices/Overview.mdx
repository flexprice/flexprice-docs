Invoices are essential for:

* Tracking revenue and outstanding payments.

* Maintaining financial records for compliance.

* Enabling clear and transparent billing for customers.

Flexprice allows you to create, manage, and update invoices directly from the dashboard or through the API.&#x20;

**Invoice Lifecycle**
Invoices progress through the following states:

* **Draft** – Created but not yet finalized; can be edited.

* **Finalized** – Locked and ready for payment processing.

* **Paid** – The customer has successfully made the payment.

* **Failed** – Payment attempt failed (e.g., insufficient funds, expired card).

* **Void** – The invoice is canceled and will not be processed further.
