title: "Partial payments"
---

Flexprice supports partial payments for invoices, allowing businesses to configure whether invoices can be partially settled using available credits. This ensures a flexible payment process for customers who may not have enough credits to cover the entire invoice.

By enabling partial payments, businesses can:

- Automatically deduct available credits from an invoice before charging the remaining balance.
- Allow invoices to be settled partially if the customer doesn’t have enough credits.

Important point to note is:

- Partial payments only apply to invoices where credits are eligible for that payment.
- If partial payments are disabled, invoices remain unpaid (pending) until the full amount is covered

  - The invoice will reflect **partial payment status** until fully paid.
