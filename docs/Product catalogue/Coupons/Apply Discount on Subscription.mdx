- **Coupon Status**: The coupon must be active
- **Validity Period**: The coupon must be within its redeem after/before dates
- **Usage Limits**: The coupon must not have exceeded its maximum redemptions
- **Customer Eligibility**: The customer must meet any coupon rules or filters
- **Plan Compatibility**: The coupon must be compatible with the selected plan

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: If a coupon doesn't apply, check the validation messages for specific reasons why the coupon is not eligible.

## Coupon Details View

This detailed view shows all the important coupon information including the discount type, amount, cadence, validity period, and current usage statistics. This helps you verify that the coupon is appropriate for the customer and subscription.

## Understanding Coupon Cadence

The way the discount applies depends on the coupon's cadence setting:

### Once

- The discount applies only to the first billing period
- After the first period, the subscription continues at full price
- Ideal for new customer promotions or one-time offers

### Repeated

- The discount applies for the specified number of billing periods
- For example, if set to 3 periods with monthly billing, the discount applies for 3 months
- Perfect for trial periods or limited-time promotions

### Forever

- The discount applies indefinitely for the lifetime of the subscription
- The discount continues even if the subscription is renewed
- Best for long-term customer retention strategies

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Customer Welcome Discount

- **Coupon**: "Welcome2024" - 20% off, Once cadence
- **Result**: Customer gets 20% off their first month, then pays full price

### Scenario 2: Quarterly Promotion

- **Coupon**: "Q1Promo" - $50 off, Repeated cadence, 3 periods
- **Result**: Customer gets $50 off for 3 consecutive billing periods

### Scenario 3: Loyalty Discount

- **Coupon**: "Loyalty" - 10% off, Forever cadence
- **Result**: Customer gets 10% off for the entire subscription duration

## Managing Applied Coupons

### View Applied Coupons

1. Navigate to the customer's subscription details
2. Look for the **Discounts** or **Applied Coupons** section
3. View the active coupons and their remaining periods

### Remove Applied Coupons

1. In the subscription details, find the applied coupon
2. Click **Remove** or **Unlink** next to the coupon
3. Confirm the removal

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Removing a coupon will affect future billing periods but won't retroactively change past invoices.

## Coupon Analytics

Monitor your coupon performance through:

- **Redemption Count**: Track how many times each coupon has been used
- **Revenue Impact**: Analyze the total discount value applied
- **Customer Acquisition**: Measure how coupons affect new customer signups
- **Retention Impact**: Evaluate how coupons influence subscription renewals

## Best Practices

1. **Test Before Launch**: Always test coupons with a small group before wide deployment
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive coupon names that indicate the purpose
3. **Set Expiry Dates**: Always set expiration dates to prevent unintended long-term discounts
4. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check coupon redemption statistics
5. **Plan for Renewals**: Consider how coupons affect subscription renewals and pricing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Coupon Not Applying**

- Check if the coupon is active and within its validity period
- Verify the customer meets any coupon rules or filters
- Ensure the coupon hasn't reached its maximum redemption limit

**Discount Amount Incorrect**

- Verify the coupon type (fixed amount vs percentage)
- Check the currency matches the subscription currency
- Confirm the discount calculation logic

**Coupon Expired Unexpectedly**
