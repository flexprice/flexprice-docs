Follow the steps below to create a feature in Flexprice:

1. In the main navigation menu, select **Features** from **Product Catalog**.

2. At the top-right of the Feature dashboard, select **Add Feature** to create a new feature.

3. Fill in the feature details:
   - **Feature Name:** Enter a unique and descriptive name for the feature (e.g., "Premium API Access").
   - **Feature Type:** Select the type of feature:
     - **Metered:** Tracks quantifiable usage (e.g., number of API calls)
     - **Boolean:** Indicates a simple on/off state (e.g., access to a premium dashboard)
     - **Static:** Represents fixed attributes or entitlements (e.g., priority support)

## Creating a Boolean Feature

1. Select **Boolean** as Type which indicates a simple on/off state (e.g., access to a premium dashboard).

## Creating a Static Feature

1. Select **Static** as feature type which represents fixed attributes or entitlements (e.g., priority support)

## Creating a Metered Feature

1. Select **Metered** as Type which tracks quantifiable usage (e.g., number of API calls).

2. Optionally edit the singular and plural unit names, for example: "token" and "tokens".

### Define Event Details

#### Event Name
For example, suppose you want to track how many tokens users consume while calling your AI model:
- **Event Name**: `tokens_total`
  - This is the unique identifier you'll use to send events that match the metric
  - Must be unique across your Flexprice account to avoid confusion with other metrics

#### Filters (Optional)
It is important to note that filters cannot be edited later, so decide up front if you'll need them for billing or reporting.

Filters let you **narrow down** which events get counted or summed in this metric. You do not have to add filters if you want to aggregate all events of a given type. However, filters become crucial if you need more granular control, such as billing for only certain AI models or distinguishing usage by environment.

**Example**: If your system supports multiple AI models (`gpt 3`, `llama3.2`, `gpt 4`), and you only want to track usage from GPT models for specialized billing, you can add a filter:

- **Key**: `model`
- **Values**: `gpt 3`, `gpt 4`

This means Flexprice will only aggregate token usage events where `model` is either `gpt 3` or `gpt 4`.

### Define Aggregation
The aggregation settings tell Flexprice how to measure your events.

#### Function
Choose one of these aggregation functions:
- **SUM**: Adds a numeric property (like tokens, price, etc.) across all matching events
- **COUNT**: Counts the total number of matching events, regardless of any numeric value in the event data
- **COUNT UNIQUE**: Counts only the unique values of a specified event property

#### Field
- The property that Flexprice sums or evaluates. For `SUM` and `COUNT UNIQUE`, this property should be numeric (e.g., `tokens`)
- If you choose `COUNT`, you typically don't specify a numeric property (because you're just counting occurrences)

#### Usage Reset
- **Cumulative**: The meter never resets. Usage keeps accumulating across billing cycles, providing a running total. This is useful for features like storage.
- **Periodic**: Usage resets at each billing period (e.g., monthly). This is ideal for most subscription-based models where usage resets for every billing period

**Example Configuration**:
- **Aggregation** = `SUM`
- **Aggregation Value** = `tokens`
- **Aggregation Type** = `Periodic` (if you invoice monthly and want usage to reset each month)
