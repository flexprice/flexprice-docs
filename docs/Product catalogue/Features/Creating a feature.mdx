# Creating a feature

Follow the steps below to create a feature in Flexprice

- In the main navigation menu, select **Features** from **Product Catalog**.
- At the top-right of the Feature dashboard, select Add Feature to create a new feature.
- **Feature Name:** Enter a unique and descriptive name for the feature (e.g., "Premium API Access").​
- **Feature Type:** Select the type of feature:​
    - **Metered:** Tracks quantifiable usage (e.g., number of API calls).​
    - **Boolean:** Indicates a simple on/off state (e.g., access to a premium dashboard).​
    - **Static:** Represents fixed attributes or entitlements (e.g., priority support).

**Creating a Boolean feature**

- Select Boolean as Type which indicates a simple on/off state (e.g., access to a premium dashboard).

**Creating a Static feature**

- Select Static as feature type which represents fixed attributes or entitlements (e.g., priority support)

**Creating a Metered feature**

- Select Metered as Type which tracks quantifiable usage (e.g., number of API calls).
- Optionally edit the singular and plural unit names, for example: "token" and "tokens".

- Define Event Details

    - Name
        - This is the unique identifier you’ll use to send events that match the metric.
        - Must be unique across your Flexprice account to avoid confusion with other metrics.
        
        **Example** Suppose you want to track how many tokens users consume while calling your AI model. In that case:
        **Event Name**: **`tokens_total`**
        
    
    - **Filters** *(Optional)*
        - Filters let you **narrow down** which events get counted or summed in this metric. You **do not** have to add filters if you want to aggregate **all** events of a given type. However, filters become crucial if you need more granular control, such as **billing for only certain AI models** or **distinguishing usage by environment**.
        - **Key & Values**
            - A filter consists of a **property key** (e.g., **`model`**) and **one or more values** (e.g., **`gpt 3`**, **`gpt 4`**).
            - Only events that match *both* the key and one of the values are included in the metric.
        
        It is important to note that filters cannot be edited later, so decide up front if you’ll need them for billing or reporting.
        
        **Example** Continuing our AI tokens example: If your system supports multiple AI models (**`gpt 3`**, **`llama3.2`**,**`gpt 4`**), and you only want to track usage from gpt models for specialized billing, you can add a filter:
        
        - **Key**: **`model`**
        - **Values**: **`gpt 3`**, **`gpt 4`**
        
        This means Flexprice will only aggregate token usage events where **`model`** is either**`gpt 3`** or  **`gpt 4`**
        

- Define Aggregation
The **aggregation** settings tell Flexprice **how** to measure your events.

    - Function
        - It can be either Sum , Count or Count Unique
            - **SUM**: Adds a numeric property (like tokens, price, etc.) across all matching events.
            - **COUNT**: It counts the total number of matching events, regardless of any numeric value in the event data.
            - **COUNT UNIQUE:** It counts only the unique values of a specified event property.
    - Field
        - The **property** that Flexprice sums or evaluates. For **`SUM`** and  **`COUNT UNIUE`**, this property should be numeric (e.g., **`tokens`**).
        - If you choose **COUNT**, you typically don’t specify a numeric property (because you’re just counting occurrences).
    - Usage reset
        - **Cumulative**: The meter never resets. Usage keeps accumulating across billing cycles, providing a running total. This is useful for features like storage.
        - **Periodic**: Usage resets at each **billing period** (e.g., monthly). This is ideal for most subscription-based models where usage resets for every billing period
    
    **Example** If you’re summing the total tokens used:
    
    - **Aggregation** = **`SUM`**
    - **Aggregation Value** = **`tokens`**
    - **Aggregation Type** = **`Periodic`** (if you invoice monthly and want usage to reset each month)
