# Link features to plans

In **Flexprice**, managing customer access to features is done through **entitlements**. An **entitlement** defines which features a customer can access based on their subscription plan. This ensures that each customer receives the correct level of access, allowing precise control over feature availability and usage limits.

**Linking Features to Plans through Entitlements**

- Choose the plan to which you want to link features.
- Navigate to the **Entitlements** section within the selected plan.
- Click **Add** to add the desired features to the plan.

- Configure access parameters, including usage limits, permissions, and other relevant settings.

- Click **Save**, and the entitlements will be applied to all customers on this plan.

**Configuring Entitlements for Different Feature Types**

- **Boolean Features**
    - Selecting a Boolean feature **grants or restricts** access for customers on this plan.
    - No further configuration is requiredâ€”just **Add** or **Cancel**.

- **Metered features**
    - **Setting the Value**

        - Enter the maximum usage limit a customer is allowed before restrictions apply.
        - If there is no cap, select Set to Infinite.
    - **Usage reset**

        - By default, metered features reset at the start of each billing period.
        - If needed, you can configure a separate reset interval, independent of the billing period.
        - When enabled, usage resets to zero at the specified interval, regardless of when the billing cycle occurs.
    
    ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A plan is billed **annually**, but API call limits **reset every month**. Setting a **monthly reset** ensures that users get a fresh allocation of calls each month.
    
    - **Soft Limit vs. Hard Limit**
    Once a customer reaches their allocated limit, there are two ways to handle additional usage:
        - Soft Limit (Overage Allowed)
            - Customers can exceed their limit.
            - Excess usage may be charged separately (based on pricing rules).
            - Common for pay-as-you-go models.
            
            ðŸ’¡ Example: A GPT API plan allows 50,000 tokens/month, but if exceeded, additional tokens are charged $0.10 per 1,000 tokens.
            
        - Hard Limit (Strict Cap)
            - Customers cannot exceed the limit.
            - Once they reach their limit, requests are blocked.
            - Typically used for free tiers or strict allowances.
- **Static Features**

    - Instead of setting limits, define a custom value.
    - Example: 24/7 support, premium customer service, AI model access.
    - Customers will see these benefits listed as part of their subscription.

The linked features are now associated with the plan, and subscribers will have access according to the configured entitlements.
