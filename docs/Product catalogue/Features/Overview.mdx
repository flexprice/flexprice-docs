A Feature in Flexprice represents a unit of functionality that customers can access, use, or be billed for.

They form the foundational building blocks of your product offering. Features define what customers can do, how much they can use, and how they are charged—like API endpoints, storage limits, premium dashboards, priority support, or advanced analytics.

**Types of features**

Flexprice allows you to define three types of features:

* **Metered Features**

* **Boolean Features**

* **Static Features**

**Boolean Features**
Boolean Features represent capabilities or functionalities that customers either have access to or don't—essentially a simple on/off switch.

For example, in a SaaS platform offering AI models shown above, a Boolean Feature like **SAML SSO Authentication** might be available only in higher-tier plans. In this case, customers on Plan 1 would not have access to SAML authentication, while those on Plan 2 would.

**Metered Features**

Metered Features track quantifiable usage by customers, allowing you to bill them based on how much they use. These features capture dynamic, variable usage over time. It forms the backbone for accurate invoicing, usage analysis, and flexible pricing plans.

In the above example, a metered feature tracks the number of **GPT tokens** processed per month. A customer on Plan 1 may have a limit of 10,000 tokens per month, while a customer on Plan 2 could have 1,000,000 tokens per month.

**Static Features**

Static Features represent fixed attributes or configurations of your product that don't dynamically change based on usage. They are generally consistent and predefined per pricing plan or tier. Unlike Metered Features or Boolean Features, Static Features remain constant and serve as descriptors of a plan’s benefits.

In this example, the Available Models is a static feature.
