# Flat fee

The **Flat Fee** model charges a consistent rate for each unit of usage. This straightforward approach ensures predictability for both the business and the customer.​

**Example:**

An API service charges **$0.05 per API call**. If a customer makes **1,000 API calls** during a billing period, their total charge would be:​

`1,000 API calls × $0.05 = $50`​

This model is ideal when the cost per unit remains constant, regardless of the total usage volume.
