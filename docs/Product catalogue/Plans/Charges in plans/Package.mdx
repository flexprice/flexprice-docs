# Package

The **Package-Based** model applies a **fixed price to a defined range of usage**. Instead of charging per unit, the entire **range of units falls under a single fixed price**.

**Example:**

A **SMS service provider** applies the following package-based pricing:

- **1 â€“ 1,000 messages** â†’ $50
- **1,001 â€“ 5,000 messages** â†’ $200
- **5,001 â€“ 10,000 messages** â†’ $350

If a customer sends **4,500 messages**, they fall within the **1,001 â€“ 5,000 messages package**, meaning they are charged **$200**, regardless of the exact count.

Even if the customer only sent 1,500 messages, they would still pay the full **$200** for the 1,001 â€“ 5,000 package.

ðŸ’¡ It is Best for ****Businesses that want to charge customers based on predefined consumption ranges rather than individual units.
