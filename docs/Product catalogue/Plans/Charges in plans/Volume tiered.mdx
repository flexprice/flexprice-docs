title: "Volume tiered"

In Flexprice, the **Volume-Tiered** model allows you to define multiple pricing tiers, where a single unit price is applied based on the total volume of usage. This means that the unit price is determined by the highest tier reached by the customer's total consumption.

**Example:**

Consider the following pricing tiers for an API service:

| Tier       | Usage Range (API Calls) | Unit Price ($) |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| **Tier 1** | 0 – 10,000              | 0.0010         |
| **Tier 2** | 10,001 – 50,000         | 0.0008         |
| **Tier 3** | 50,001 – 100,000        | 0.0006         |
| **Tier 4** | 100,001 and above       | 0.0004         |

If a customer makes **65,000 API calls** in a billing period, their total usage falls within **Tier 3** (50,001 – 100,000 calls) with a unit price of **$0.0006**. The total charge would be:

`65,000 API calls × $0.0006 = $39`​

This model ensures that customers are charged a consistent rate for all units based on their total usage volume, which can either increase or decrease depending on the defined tiers.
