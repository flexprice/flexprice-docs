## How Commitment Discounts Work

### Basic Concept
- Customer commits to a minimum usage amount
- Discounted pricing applies to all usage within the commitment
- Overage charges apply for usage beyond the commitment

### Commitment Periods
- **Monthly**: 1-month commitment cycles
- **Quarterly**: 3-month commitment cycles  
- **Annual**: 12-month commitment cycles

## Setting Up Commitment Discounts

### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Plan Management
2. Select or create a plan with usage-based pricing
3. Enable "Commitment Discounts" feature
4. Configure commitment tiers and discount rates
5. Set minimum usage requirements

### Commitment Tiers Example
```
Tier 1: 0-1,000 units → $0.10 per unit
Tier 2: 1,001-5,000 units → $0.08 per unit (20% discount)
Tier 3: 5,001-10,000 units → $0.06 per unit (40% discount)
Tier 4: 10,001+ units → $0.05 per unit (50% discount)
```

## Configuration Options

### Minimum Commitment
- Set minimum usage requirement for discount eligibility
- Example: 1,000 API calls per month minimum

### Discount Structure
- **Percentage-based**: 10%, 20%, 30% off standard rates
- **Fixed-rate**: $0.05, $0.08, $0.10 per unit
- **Tiered**: Different rates for different usage bands

### Rollover Policies
- **No Rollover**: Unused commitment expires
- **Partial Rollover**: Up to 50% unused commitment carries forward
- **Full Rollover**: All unused commitment carries forward

## Billing and Invoicing

### Commitment Tracking
- Real-time usage monitoring against commitments
- Automatic discount application during billing
- Clear reporting on commitment utilization

### Invoice Examples
```
Monthly Commitment: 5,000 API calls
Actual Usage: 4,200 API calls
Standard Rate: $0.10 per call
Commitment Rate: $0.06 per call

Billing Calculation:
4,200 calls × $0.06 = $252.00
```

## Best Practices

### For Businesses
1. **Analyze Usage Patterns**: Understand customer usage before setting commitments
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with conservative discount rates
3. **Monitor Adoption**: Track commitment uptake and adjust pricing
4. **Clear Communication**: Explain commitment benefits to customers

### For Customers
1. **Usage Forecasting**: Estimate usage before committing
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Track usage against commitments
3. **Optimization**: Adjust usage patterns to maximize discount benefits
