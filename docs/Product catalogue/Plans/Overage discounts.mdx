## How Overage Discounts Work

### Basic Concept
- Standard pricing applies within plan limits
- Discounted pricing applies to usage beyond limits
- Encourages customers to use more of your service

### Overage Scenarios
- **Plan Limit Exceeded**: Usage beyond included plan limits
- **Commitment Exceeded**: Usage beyond committed volumes
- **Tier Thresholds**: Usage beyond specific tier boundaries

## Setting Up Overage Discounts

### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Plan Management
2. Select a plan with usage-based pricing
3. Enable "Overage Discounts" feature
4. Configure overage tiers and discount rates
5. Set threshold limits for each tier

### Overage Tiers Example
```
Included Usage: 0-1,000 units (included in plan)
Overage Tier 1: 1,001-5,000 units → $0.08 per unit (20% discount)
Overage Tier 2: 5,001-10,000 units → $0.06 per unit (40% discount)
Overage Tier 3: 10,001+ units → $0.05 per unit (50% discount)
```

## Configuration Options

### Overage Thresholds
- **Plan-based**: Beyond included plan limits
- **Commitment-based**: Beyond committed usage volumes
- **Custom thresholds**: User-defined breakpoints

### Discount Structure
- **Percentage Discounts**: 10%, 20%, 30% off standard overage rates
- **Fixed Rates**: Lower per-unit pricing for overage usage
- **Progressive Discounts**: Increasing discounts for higher usage

### Billing Frequency
- **Real-time**: Discounts applied immediately
- **End-of-period**: Discounts calculated at billing cycle end
- **Accumulative**: Discounts based on total period usage

## Billing Examples

### Example 1: Plan Limit Exceeded
```
Plan: Basic Plan (1,000 API calls included)
Actual Usage: 2,500 API calls
Standard Rate: $0.10 per call
Overage Rate: $0.08 per call

Billing Calculation:
1,000 calls (included) × $0.00 = $0.00
1,500 calls (overage) × $0.08 = $120.00
Total: $120.00
```

### Example 2: Commitment Exceeded
```
Commitment: 5,000 API calls at $0.06 per call
Actual Usage: 7,000 API calls
Overage Rate: $0.05 per call

Billing Calculation:
5,000 calls (commitment) × $0.06 = $300.00
2,000 calls (overage) × $0.05 = $100.00
Total: $400.00
```

## Advanced Features
