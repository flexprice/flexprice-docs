**Price Overrides** in Flexprice allow you to **customize pricing for specific customers** by modifying individual charges within a plan during subscription creation. This feature is particularly useful for offering special pricing, discounts, or custom rates for enterprise customers, early adopters, or promotional campaigns.

## When to Use Price Overrides

Price overrides are ideal for scenarios such as:

- **Enterprise deals** with custom pricing arrangements
- **Promotional pricing** for specific customers or campaigns
- **Volume discounts** applied at the customer level
- **Trial or beta pricing** for early adopters
- **Negotiated rates** for strategic partnerships

## How to Override Plan Prices

### Step 1: Navigate to Customer Subscription Creation

- Go to **Customer Catalog** in the main navigation
- Select the customer you want to create a subscription for
- Click **Add** to create a new subscription

### Step 2: Select a Plan

- Choose the pricing plan from the dropdown menu
- The system will display the subscription preview with all charges

### Step 3: Access the Charges Table

## Important Notes

- **Plan Integrity**: Price overrides only affect the specific subscription being created. The original plan pricing remains unchanged for other customers.

- **Billing Consistency**: Overridden prices will be used for all future billing cycles unless the subscription is modified.

- **Audit Trail**: All price overrides are tracked and can be reviewed in the subscription history.

- **Currency Support**: Price overrides work with all supported currencies in your Flexprice account.

## Best Practices

- **Document Overrides**: Keep records of why specific overrides were applied for business continuity.

- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review overridden subscriptions to ensure pricing remains appropriate.

- **Clear Communication**: Ensure your team understands when and how to use price overrides.

- **Validation**: Double-check override amounts before saving to avoid billing errors.

Price overrides provide the flexibility needed for complex pricing scenarios while maintaining the structure and consistency of your pricing plans.
