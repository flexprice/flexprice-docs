## How Versioned Changes Work

### Plan Versioning
- **Version History**: Maintain complete history of plan changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing customers remain on their current version
- **Migration Options**: Provide upgrade paths to newer versions
- **Change Tracking**: Document all modifications with timestamps

### Version States
- **Draft**: Plan changes in development
- **Active**: Currently available for new customers
- **Deprecated**: No longer available for new customers
- **Archived**: Completely removed from system

## Creating Plan Versions

### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Plan Management
2. Select the plan to modify
3. Click "Create New Version"
4. Make desired changes to pricing or features
5. Set effective date and migration options
6. Review and publish

### Version Naming Convention
```
Plan Name v1.0 → Plan Name v1.1 → Plan Name v2.0
```

## Types of Changes

### Pricing Changes
- **Price Increases**: Higher rates for existing features
- **Price Decreases**: Lower rates for existing features
- **New Pricing Tiers**: Additional pricing options
- **Discount Adjustments**: Changes to discount structures

### Feature Changes
- **Feature Additions**: New capabilities added to plan
- **Feature Removals**: Capabilities removed from plan
- **Feature Modifications**: Changes to existing features
- **Usage Limit Changes**: Adjustments to included limits

## Migration Strategies

### Automatic Migration
- **Grandfathering**: Keep existing customers on current version
- **Auto-upgrade**: Automatically move customers to new version
- **Opt-in**: Allow customers to choose when to upgrade
- **Scheduled**: Migrate customers on specific dates

### Manual Migration
- **Customer Notification**: Inform customers of available upgrades
- **Migration Incentives**: Offer discounts for early adoption
- **Support Period**: Provide assistance during transition
- **Rollback Options**: Allow reverting to previous version

## Configuration Examples

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.flexprice.com/v1/plans/{plan_id}/versions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

      }
    },
    "migration_strategy": "grandfather",
    "effective_date": "2024-01-01"
  }'
```

### Migration Configuration
```json
{
  "migration_type": "scheduled",
  "migration_date": "2024-03-01",
  "notification_period": 30,
  "incentive": {
    "type": "discount",
    "amount": 20,
    "duration": 3
  }
}
```

## Customer Impact Management

### Communication Strategy
- **Advance Notice**: Notify customers 30-60 days before changes
- **Change Documentation**: Provide detailed explanation of modifications
- **Impact Assessment**: Show how changes affect individual customers
- **Support Channels**: Offer assistance for questions and concerns

### Transition Period
- **Grace Period**: Allow time for customers to adjust
- **Temporary Pricing**: Offer special rates during transition
- **Feature Parity**: Ensure no loss of functionality
- **Data Migration**: Help transfer data if needed

## Best Practices

### For Businesses
1. **Plan Ahead**: Design changes with customer impact in mind
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate changes before deployment
3. **Communicate Clearly**: Provide transparent information about changes
4. **Monitor Impact**: Track customer reactions and adjust accordingly

### Version Management
1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, frequent updates rather than large changes
2. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all changes
3. **Testing**: Test changes with a subset of customers first
4. **Rollback Plan**: Have contingency plans for reverting changes
