**Flexprice** supports the following **aggregation types:**

| Aggregation | Description | Transcription |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **COUNT** | Counts event occurrences for basic usage tracking | COUNT(DISTINCT events.id) |
| **SUM** | Aggregates numeric property values across events | SUM(events.properties.property_name) |
| **AVERAGE** | Computes mean values from event properties | AVG(events.properties.property_name) |
| **COUNT UNIQUE** | Tracks distinct property values for unique metrics | COUNT_DISTINCT(events.properties.property_name) |
| **LATEST** | Captures the most recent property value by timestamp | argMax(events.properties.property_name, timestamp) |
| **SUM WITH MULTIPLIER** | Applies configurable rate multipliers to summed values | SUM(events.properties.property_name) * multiplier |
| **MAX** | Identifies peak values with optional bucketing support | MAX(events.properties.property_name) |
| **WEIGHTED SUM** | Time-proportional aggregation for capacity-based billing | Weighted calculation based on event duration |

All aggregation types except **COUNT** operate on event properties. **The result of this aggregation will be used to calculate charges.**
