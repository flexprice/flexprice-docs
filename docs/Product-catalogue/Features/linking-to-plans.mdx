title: "Link features to plans"
---

In **Flexprice**, managing customer access to features is done through **entitlements**. An **entitlement** defines which features a customer can access based on their subscription plan. This ensures that each customer receives the correct level of access, allowing precise control over feature availability and usage limits.

**Linking Features to Plans through Entitlements**

* Choose the plan to which you want to link features.

* Navigate to the **Entitlements** section within the selected plan.

* Click **Add** to add the desired features to the plan.

  * Selecting a Boolean feature **grants or restricts** access for customers on this plan.

    * Enter the maximum usage limit a customer is allowed before restrictions apply.

    * If there is no cap, select Set to Infinite.

  * **Usage reset**

    * By default, metered features reset at the start of each billing period.

    * If needed, you can configure a separate reset interval, independent of the billing period.

    * When enabled, usage resets to zero at the specified interval, regardless of when the billing cycle occurs.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A plan is billed **annually**, but API call limits **reset every month**. Setting a **monthly reset** ensures that users get a fresh allocation of calls each month.

* **Soft Limit vs. Hard Limit**
  Once a customer reaches their allocated limit, there are two ways to handle additional usage:

  * Soft Limit (Overage Allowed)

    * Customers can exceed their limit.

    * Excess usage may be charged separately (based on pricing rules).

    * Common for pay-as-you-go models.

ðŸ’¡ Example: A GPT API plan allows 50,000 tokens/month, but if exceeded, additional tokens are charged $0.10 per 1,000 tokens.

* Hard Limit (Strict Cap)

  * Customers cannot exceed the limit.

  * Once they reach their limit, requests are blocked.

  * Typically used for free tiers or strict allowances.

* **Static Features**

  * Instead of setting limits, define a custom value.

  * Example: 24/7 support, premium customer service, AI model access.

  * Customers will see these benefits listed as part of their subscription.

The linked features are now associated with the plan, and subscribers will have access according to the configured entitlements.
