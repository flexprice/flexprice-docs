title: "Localisation"
---

As businesses scale globally, **pricing localization becomes critical** for acquiring and retaining customers across different regions. A **one-size-fits-all pricing strategy doesn’t work** when:

- **Customers expect to pay in their local currency** rather than USD or EUR.
- **Exchange rate fluctuations impact affordability** and purchasing decisions.
- **Regional taxes and compliance requirements** require billing in local currencies.
- **Enterprise customers negotiate contracts in multiple currencies**, making flexible invoicing essential.

Flexprice provides **full multi-currency support** across both **recurring and usage-based charges**, allowing businesses to price their products flexibly across global markets.

**Creating Plans with Multiple Currencies**\
With Flexprice, you don't need to create separate plans for each currency. When setting up pricing plans, you can define a**single plan with multiple currency options**  → e.g., `$99 USD/month`, `€89 EUR/month`, `₹7,999 INR/month`.

**Assigning Subscriptions in a Specific Currency**\
While a single pricing plan can support multiple currencies, a customer’s subscription must be assigned in one currency.\
This is because:

- **Invoices are generated per subscription.** Since invoices are currency-specific, each **subscription must have a single currency** for accurate billing, tax calculation, and revenue reporting.
- To offer **multiple currencies to a customer, assign multiple subscriptions.**
