## Downgrade Process

2. Click "Downgrade Subscription" button
3. Select the target plan from available options
4. Choose downgrade timing (immediate or scheduled)
5. Review impact on current usage and confirm

### Via API
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.flexprice.com/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/downgrade" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_plan_id": "plan_456",
    "effective_date": "next_billing_cycle",
    "reason": "Customer requested cost reduction"
  }'
```

## Usage Considerations

Before downgrading, consider the impact on current usage:

- **Over-limit Usage**: Current usage may exceed new plan limits
- **Feature Dependencies**: Some features may become unavailable
- **Data Retention**: Historical data remains accessible

## Downgrade Scenarios

### Plan Tier Downgrade
- Moving from Enterprise to Pro plan
- Downgrading from Pro to Basic
- Reducing seat count or licenses

### Feature Reduction
- Removing premium features
- Reducing usage limits
- Disabling advanced capabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Usage Analysis**: Review current usage before downgrading
2. **Customer Communication**: Explain impact of changes
3. **Grace Period**: Consider allowing over-limit usage temporarily
4. **Data Export**: Ensure customers can export data if needed
