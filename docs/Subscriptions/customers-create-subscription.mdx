### **Managing Multiple Subscriptions for a Customer**

- A single customer can have multiple active subscriptions.

- Each subscription operates independently based on its assigned billing period, charges, and start date.

- For example, a customer can have both a `Basic Plan` and an `Addon: AI Agent Sessions` subscription, each billed separately.

### **Customizing Subscription Pricing**

- **Override Line Items**: Customize pricing for specific subscriptions by overriding plan prices
- **Special Pricing**: Offer enterprise discounts, bulk pricing, or promotional rates
- **Flexible Billing**: Modify billing models, tier structures, and quantities per subscription

For comprehensive information on customizing subscription pricing, see [Subscription Override Line Items](/docs/subscriptions/override-line-items).
