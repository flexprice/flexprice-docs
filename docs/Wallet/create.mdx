A wallet in Flexprice acts as a virtual account linked to a customer. It allows for storing and managing credits that can be applied toward subscription payments, usage-based charges, or other transactions.

Flexprice enable you to manage prepaid credits for your customers. These are credits added to a wallet and can be consumed for billing purposes. Wallets ensure an efficient and transparent mechanism for credit handling, aligning with subscription and usage-based pricing models. Wallets operate in a defined currency and can be topped up manually or automatically.

**Creating a Wallet**

* Go to the **Customers** section in the dashboard.

* Select the desired customer.

* Navigate to the **Wallet** tab in the customer’s profile.

* If no wallet exists for the customer, you will see a message: *“No wallet linked to the customer yet.”*

  * **Wallet Name**: Assign a name to the wallet. By default, it will be “Prepaid Wallet.”

  * **Currency**: Select the currency in which this wallet will operate (e.g., USD, INR).
    Note: Only **one active wallet per currency** is allowed for a customer. If a wallet for the selected currency already exists, you must deactivate it before creating a new one.

  * Currently, only **Free Credits** can be added. These credits do not generate an invoice, as they are granted without charge. Also, the credit-to-currency ratio is **1:1** (e.g., 1 credit equals 1 USD or 1 INR)

  * Click **Save Wallet** to finalise the creation process.

* The wallet will now appear in the Wallet tab for the customer, showing the balance and available credits.
