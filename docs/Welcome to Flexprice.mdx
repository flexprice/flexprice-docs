**Flexprice** is an open-source platform for metering, billing and feature management, built by developers, for developers. It handles the heavy lifting of usage tracking, feature access, and billing logic—so you don't have to build them from scratch.

**Flexprice isn't here to replace your existing billing stack** (Stripe, Chargebee, etc.); instead, it **adds a flexible layer** on top of it. It gives you the control and flexibility to implement usage-based and hybrid pricing models, manage credits, control feature access, and more—without the complexity of building everything in-house.

### Billing is a Developer Problem

Building billing systems is **complex and time-consuming**. Implementing metering, usage tracking, and dynamic billing rules involves a lot of moving parts and edge cases. 

Traditional billing services are often rigid. They handle basic subscriptions or payments well, but anything beyond that (credit management, feature gating, custom invoice logic) forces developers to create workarounds. This means engineering teams end up writing and maintaining tons of custom code for things like prorated subscriptions, usage limits, time zone differences, and tax calculations. 

In short, billing becomes a [**developer problem**](https://www.notion.so/1a99c8ea9cb080acb0b9c0d9d10fba2b?pvs=21) when the tools don't flex to your product's needs, eating up valuable development time and causing endless maintenance headaches.

### Why Flexprice?

Flexprice **solves these challenges** by providing:

- **Developer-first design:** Plug-and-play SDKs for popular languages make integration seamless. Just send usage events, and Flexprice handles aggregation, metering, and billing logic in real time.
- **Open-source control:** Self-host Flexprice on your own infrastructure for full transparency and control. There's no vendor lock-in or surprise fees.
- **Composable with your stack:** Flexprice doesn't replace your billing provider (Stripe, Chargebee, etc.). Instead, it manages pricing, usage data, and entitlements while you continue using your preferred payment processor or CRM.

In short, Flexprice lets your team focus on **building your product**, not building a billing system from scratch.
