# What is Flexprice?

**Flexprice** is an open-source platform for metering, billing and feature management, built by developers, for developers. It handles the heavy lifting of usage tracking, feature access, and billing logic — so you don’t have to build them from scratch.

To get a quick overview of the product, watch this quick demo:

    className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
  />
</div>

Traditional billing services are often rigid. They handle basic subscriptions or payments well, but anything beyond that (credit management, feature gating, custom invoice logic) forces developers to create workarounds. This means engineering teams end up writing and maintaining tons of custom code for things like prorated subscriptions, usage limits, time zone differences and tax calculations.

In short, billing becomes a developer problem when the tools don’t flex to your product’s needs, eating up valuable development time and causing endless maintenance headaches.
