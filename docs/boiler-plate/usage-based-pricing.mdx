</Frame>

## 1. Key Chargeable Features in Vapi

- charges customers primarily for **hosting and orchestration**, not for the underlying AI or telecom providers directly.

### A. Hosting Fee for Call Minutes

It charges a **fixed hosting fee per call minute.**

**Pricing (Pay As You Go):**

- **$0.05 per minute**

---

### B. Hosting Cost for SMS / Chat Messages

It also charges a **fixed hosting fee per message.**

**Pricing (Pay As You Go):**

- **$0.005 per message**

---

## 2. Fixed Fees vs Usage-Based Charges

Pricing consists of **fixed per-unit fees**, not bundled plans or feature-based tiers.

### Fixed Fees (Platform Hosting Costs)

These fees are **fixed per unit of usage**:

| Feature            | Pricing Model | Cost         |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Call Hosting       | Per minute    | $0.05 / min  |
| SMS / Chat Hosting | Per message   | $0.005 / msg |

These fees remain the same regardless of scale (Pay As You Go).

---

### Usage-Based Scaling

| Usage Dimension   | Pay As You Go                    | Enterprise   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Call Minutes      | Usage based                      | Custom       |
| SMS / Chat Volume | Usage based                      | Volume based |
| Call Concurrency  | 10 included + $10 / line / month | Custom       |

---

## 3. Call Concurrency Pricing

Call concurrency determines **how many simultaneous calls** your system can handle.

### Pay As You Go

- **10 concurrent calls included**
- **$10 per additional line per month**

### Enterprise

- Custom concurrency limits
- Volume-based pricing
- SLA-backed infrastructure

---

## 4. Enterprise Pricing Model

The **Enterprise plan** operates under an **annual contract** with custom pricing.

**Enterprise features include:**

- Custom call minute pricing
- Volume-based SMS and chat pricing
- Priority support and SLAs

> Enterprise pricing is negotiated directly with the Vapi sales team.

    Click **Add Subscription** to save.

    The subscription will now appear under the customer's details with status "Active".

    For comprehensive information on creating subscriptions, see [Create Subscription](/docs/subscriptions/customers-create-subscription).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5: Create Usage Events">
    Once a customer has an active subscription, you can start sending usage events to Flexprice via API.

    **API Endpoint:**
    ```
    POST https://api.cloud.flexprice.io/v1/events
    ```

    **Authentication:**
    Include your API key in the request header:
    ```
    x-api-key: <your_api_key>
    ```


    **Example 1: Send SMS/Chat Message Event**

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.cloud.flexprice.io/v1/events \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
      --data '{
        "event_name": "sms.chat.message",
        "external_customer_id": "cust_acme_001",
        "properties": {
          "messages": 1
        },
        "event_id": "evt_sms_67890",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:35:00.000Z",
        "source": "vapi-platform"
      }'
    ```

    **Example 2: Bulk Events (Multiple Events at Once)**

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.cloud.flexprice.io/v1/events/bulk \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
      --data '{
        "events": [
          {
            "event_name": "call.minutes",
            "external_customer_id": "cust_acme_001",
            "properties": { "minutes": 10 },
            "source": "vapi-platform"
          },
          {
            "event_name": "sms.chat.message",
            "external_customer_id": "cust_acme_001",
            "properties": { "messages": 3 },
            "source": "vapi-platform"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    **Event Payload Fields:**
    - **event_name** (required): Must match your feature's Event Name exactly (`call.minutes` or `sms.chat.message`)
    - **external_customer_id** (required): Must match the customer's External ID (`cust_acme_001`)
    - **properties** (required): Contains the aggregation field value
      - For Call Minutes: `{"minutes": <number>}`
      - For SMS/Chat: `{"messages": <number>}`
    - **event_id** (optional): Your unique identifier for the event
    - **timestamp** (optional): ISO 8601 UTC timestamp. If omitted, server time is used
    - **source** (optional): Origin of the event (e.g., "vapi-platform", "api")

    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "event_id": "event_01K389J4M1F1NZG6XP0AMD6J52",
      "message": "Event accepted for processing"
    }
    ```

    For comprehensive information on sending events, see [Sending Events](/docs/event-ingestion/sending-events).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 6: Verify Events with Event Debugger">
    After sending usage events, verify they are being processed correctly using the Event Debugger.

    **Navigate to Event Debugger:**
    1. Go to **FlexPrice Dashboard** → **Usage Tracking** → **Event Debugger**

    **View Events:**
    The Event Debugger displays a real-time stream of events with:
    - **Event ID**: Unique identifier for each event
    - **Event Name**: The feature being tracked (`call.minutes` or `sms.chat.message`)
    - **Customer Lookup Key**: Customer's External ID
    - **Source**: Origin of the event
    - **Timestamp**: When the event occurred

    **View Event Details:**
    Click on any event to view the complete payload:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "event_01",
      "external_customer_id": "cust_acme_001",
      "event_name": "call.minutes",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "properties": {
        "minutes": 5.5
      },
      "source": "vapi-platform"
    }
    ```

    **Filter Events:**
    Use filters to find specific events:
    - **Filter by Event Name**: `event_name contains "call.minutes"`
    - **Filter by Customer**: `external_customer_id contains "cust_acme_001"`
    - **Filter by Time Range**: Set Start Time and End Time
    - **Filter by Source**: `source contains "vapi-platform"`

    **Verify Event Processing:**
    1. Check that events appear in the Event Debugger shortly after sending
    2. Verify the event payload matches what you sent
    3. Confirm the `external_customer_id` matches your customer
    4. Ensure `event_name` matches your feature configuration exactly
    5. Check that `properties` contain the correct aggregation field values



    For comprehensive information on event debugging, see [Event Debugger](/docs/event-ingestion/event-debugger) and [Validating Events](/docs/event-ingestion/validating-events).

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

After completing the setup:

1. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check the Event Debugger to ensure events are being processed
2. **Review Invoices**: Check upcoming invoices to verify billing calculations
3. **Track Usage**: Use the Query tool to view aggregated usage by customer and feature
4. **Scale**: Add more customers and subscriptions as your business grows
