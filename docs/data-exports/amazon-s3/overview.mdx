## Summary

The Amazon S3 Export feature enables automated, scheduled exports of your Flexprice data directly to Amazon S3 buckets. This enterprise-grade solution provides a comprehensive approach to data export with flexible scheduling, secure storage, and complete execution tracking.

**Key Features:**

- **Four Data Types**: Export invoices, events, credit top-ups, and credit usage data in standard CSV format
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Configure hourly or daily automated exports based on your business needs
- **Manual Exports**: Trigger on-demand exports anytime for immediate data access or testing
- **Secure Storage**: Multiple encryption options (AES256, AWS KMS) for data at rest
- **Cost Optimization**: GZIP compression support to reduce storage costs by 70-80%
- **Execution Tracking**: Comprehensive run history and monitoring for all export operations
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Scalable architecture with compression, encryption, and easy integration

By implementing S3 Export, you can automate data backups, feed data warehouses, meet compliance requirements, and integrate Flexprice data with your broader data infrastructure.
