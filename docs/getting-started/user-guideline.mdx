## Core Entities in Flexprice

Before creating a subscription, it’s important to understand the main building blocks.

### 1. Customer

Represents **who you are billing**.

Examples:

- Individual user
- Company / Organization
- Team or workspace

A customer can have:

- One or more subscriptions
- Multiple invoices and payments
- Usage events (for metered billing)

---

### 2. Plan

Represents **what you are selling**.

A plan defines:

- Pricing (free, flat, or usage-based)
- Billing interval (monthly, yearly)
- Feature limits and entitlements
- Add-ons, taxes, and discounts

Plans are reusable and **not tied to a single customer**.

---

### 3. Subscription

Represents **the relationship between a customer and a plan**.

A subscription controls:

- When billing starts and ends
- Invoice generation
- Subscription status (active, trial, cancelled)
- Upgrades and downgrades
