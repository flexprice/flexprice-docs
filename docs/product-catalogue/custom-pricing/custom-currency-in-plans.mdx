description: "Add recurring and usage-based charges to a plan in a custom currency and assign them to specific features."

You can use **custom price units** (custom currency) when adding charges to a plan. Charges can be **recurring** or **usage-based**, and each charge is assigned to a **display name** (e.g. a feature or plan label). Values are shown and entered in your custom currency (e.g. fpc); Flexprice bills in your base currency (e.g. USD).

**Before you start:** Create at least one **price unit** and set its status to **Active** (published). See [Custom Pricing](/docs/product-catalogue/custom-pricing/custom-pricing) to create a price unit.

## View plan charges (recurring and usage-based)

Plans list all charges in the **Overview** tab. Each row shows the **Display Name** (the feature or item the charge is assigned to), **Charge Type** (Recurring or Usage Based), **Billing Period**, **Billing Timing**, **Status**, and **Value**. When a charge uses a custom currency, the value is shown with the price unit’s symbol (e.g. **==15** for 15 units of your custom currency).

* **Display Name** — Identifies the feature or charge (e.g. pro, test_pu, gpt 40). This is what the charge is assigned to.
* **Charge Type** — **Recurring** (fixed per period) or **Usage Based** (depends on usage).
* **Value** — Amount in the selected currency. Custom currency uses the price unit symbol (e.g. ==0.99, ==15); standard currency uses a symbol like $19.

## Add charges with custom currency

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the plan">
    Go to **Product Catalog** → **Plans**. Select the plan you want to add charges to (e.g. **Pro**).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add charges">
    On the plan page, click **+ Add** in the Charges section (or use **Edit** and then add charges). This opens **Add Charges to [plan name]**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose currency (Custom or Standard)">
    In the charge form, open the **Currency** dropdown. You will see:
    * **Custom** — Your saved price units (e.g. **fpc (==)** with conversion rate “1 fpc = 1.27 USD”). Select a custom currency to charge in that unit.
    * **Standard** — Standard currencies (USD, INR, EUR, etc.).

    Select your **custom price unit** (e.g. fpc) to define the charge in that currency. Billing is still in your base currency.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add recurring or usage-based charges">
    Use **Add Recurring Charges** for a fixed amount per billing period (e.g. 15 fpc/month). Use **Add Usage Based Charges** for charges that depend on usage (e.g. per API call in fpc). Set **Display Name** so the charge is assigned to the right feature or label. Enter the **value** in the custom unit (e.g. 15 for 15 fpc/month).

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The new charges appear in the plan’s Charges table with values shown in your custom currency (e.g. ==15, ==0.99). They are assigned to the display names you set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Price units list

Custom currencies are managed under **Product Catalog** → **Price Units**. The table shows **Name**, **Code**, **Symbol**, **Base Currency**, **Conversion Rate**, and **Status**. Only price units with **Active** status can be selected when adding charges to a plan.

* **Code** (e.g. fpc) — Used when selecting the currency in the Add Charges form.
* **Conversion Rate** — How one unit of the custom currency converts to base currency (e.g. 1.27 means 1 fpc = 1.27 USD).
* **Status** — Must be **Active** for the price unit to appear in the Currency dropdown.
