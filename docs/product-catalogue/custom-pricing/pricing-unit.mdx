title: "Pricing unit"
description: "This feature allows you to create and use your own currency in Flexprice. With create Price Units, add them to plans and wallets in custom currency."
---

**Custom pricing** allows you to price features using your own unit (such as credits) instead of only standard currencies like USD or EUR.


### What is custom currency?

**Custom currency** is pricing in your own unit (such as credits) instead of a standard money currency like USD or EUR. You set and show prices in that unit-for example, "10 credits per month"-and **Flexprice converts those amounts to your base currency (e.g. USD) for billing**, This ensures a consistent currency for accounting, even though the feature is shown in credits.

---

## How it works internally

All billing calculations are performed using the pricing unit’s base currency (for example, USD). Amounts are defined and displayed in the **pricing unit** (e.g. credits), Conversion happens only at price or wallet creation; Flexprice uses the base currency for all calculations. In other words: input and display use the pricing unit; computation, persistence, and invoicing use base currency.


Conversion uses the formula **amount in your unit × conversion_rate = amount in base currency**. Rounding and precision (e.g. two decimals for USD, zero for JPY) are applied only when **invoice charges are computed**, not at conversion or when creating prices or price units.


Wallet balance is always shown in **base currency and credits**, whether the wallet was created with fiat or a custom price unit. Flexprice **stores and bills** everything in the base currency (e.g. USD).

---

## Using custom currency

1. **Create** a Price Unit (dashboard or API, below).
2. **Use in plans** — add charges or create prices in your unit; see [Use cases](/docs/product-catalogue/custom-pricing/use-cases#use-custom-currency-in-plans-and-prices).
3. **Use in wallets** — create a wallet in your unit; see [Use cases](/docs/product-catalogue/custom-pricing/use-cases).

---

## Use cases

- **Credits or tokens** - Sell in credits or tokens; show balance and charges in that unit while billing and storing in base currency (e.g. USD).
- **Multi-currency display, single-currency billing** - Present prices in a custom unit per region or product while retaining one base currency for accounting and payouts.

---

## Concepts and terminology

**Custom currency / Price Unit** - Your own pricing unit (e.g. credits) used instead of fiat currency. Defined once as a Price Unit and reused across plans, prices, and wallets, with automatic conversion to the base currency for billing.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **code** | **3-character** identifier (e.g. `CRD`, `TOK`, `fpc`) used when referencing the unit in a price or wallet. Must be unique per environment when Active. |
| **symbol** | Display symbol shown in the UI and on invoices (e.g. ¢, ==). |
| **base_currency** | The standard currency the unit is pegged to (e.g. `usd`). All billing and storage use this currency. |
| **conversion_rate** | Multiplier from the custom unit to base currency. |

**Conversion formula**

```text
amount in your unit × conversion_rate = amount in base currency
```

**Example:** If 1 credit = 0.01 USD, set `conversion_rate = "0.01"`. Then 100 credits = 1.00 USD.

**Price unit types: FIAT vs CUSTOM**

- **FIAT** - Amounts are in a standard currency (USD, EUR, etc.). No conversion is applied.
- **CUSTOM** - Amounts are in a Price Unit. Flexprice converts to base currency for billing; you configure and display values in the custom unit.

## Create a Price Unit (dashboard)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Price Units">
    Go to **Product Catalog** → **Price Units** → **Add** (or **Create Price Unit**).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the details">
    Enter **Name**, **Code**, **Symbol**, **Base currency**, and **Conversion rate**.  
    Example: 100 units = 1 USD → use conversion rate **0.01**.
  </Step>

</Steps>

</Frame>

## Create a Price Unit (API)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call the create endpoint">
    Send `POST /v1/prices/units` with a JSON body (you can see example below).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the required fields">
    Include **name**, **code**, **symbol**, **base_currency**, and **conversion_rate**. Optionally **metadata**.
  </Step>

</Steps>

**Example request**

```json
{
  "name": "Credits",
  "code": "CRD",
  "symbol": "¢",
  "base_currency": "usd",
  "conversion_rate": "0.01",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Conversion, 100 CRD = 1.00 USD. Base URL options: `https://us.api.flexprice.io/v1` or `https://api.cloud.flexprice.io/v1` (check out the [Create price unit](/api-reference/price-units/create-a-new-price-unit)).

## Use custom currency in plans and prices

You can add charges or create prices in your custom unit from the **dashboard** or via the **API**. In both cases you choose your Price Unit and enter amounts in that unit; Flexprice converts to base currency for billing.

### Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the plan">
    Go to **Product Catalog** → **Plans** → open the plan you want to edit.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add charges in custom currency">
    In **Charges**, click **+ Add** (or **Edit** then add). In the **Currency** dropdown choose **Custom** and select your Price Unit. Add recurring or usage-based charges and enter amounts in your unit (e.g. 15 credits/month). Click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more detail and screenshots, see [Use cases: add charges and wallet](/docs/product-catalogue/custom-pricing/use-cases).

### API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the price to use your unit">
    In the create-price request (`POST /v1/prices`), set **price_unit_type** to **CUSTOM** and include **price_unit_config**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set price_unit and amount or tiers">
    In **price_unit_config** set **price_unit** (your unit’s code, e.g. `CRD`). For a fixed amount use **amount**; for tiered pricing use **price_unit_tiers** only (not the top-level **tiers** field).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example: fixed monthly price in credits**

The request must also include **type** (e.g. `FIXED`), **billing_cadence** (e.g. `RECURRING`), and **invoice_cadence** (e.g. `ADVANCE` or `ARREAR`). Below shows the custom-pricing–relevant fields:

```json
{
  "currency": "usd",
  "price_unit_type": "CUSTOM",
  "type": "FIXED",
  "billing_model": "FLAT_FEE",
  "billing_period": "MONTHLY",
  "billing_cadence": "RECURRING",
  "invoice_cadence": "ADVANCE",
  "entity_type": "PLAN",
  "entity_id": "your-plan-id",
  "price_unit_config": {
    "price_unit": "CRD",
    "amount": "100.00"
  }
}
```

With `conversion_rate = "0.01"`, 100 CRD = 1.00 USD. Flexprice stores both the custom amount and the base-currency amount and uses base currency for billing.

**Billing models**

| Model | In price_unit_config | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| FLAT_FEE | **price_unit**, **amount** | Fixed price in your unit. |
| PACKAGE | **price_unit**, **amount** | **transform_quantity** is required; for usage add **meter_id**. |
| TIERED | **price_unit**, **price_unit_tiers** | Use **price_unit_tiers** only, not top-level **tiers**. For usage add **meter_id**. |
