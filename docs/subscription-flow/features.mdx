## Overview

In FlexPrice, **Features are the foundation of your pricing and billing system**.  
A feature represents **what your customer consumes, accesses, or is entitled to**.

Before creating:

- Plans
- Subscriptions
- Usage-based billing

You **must** define features in the **Product Catalog**.

This guide walks you through **how to create a feature correctly**, explains **every required and important field**, and helps you understand how features behave in real-world billing systems.

---

## Prerequisites

Before creating a feature, ensure that:

- You have access to the **FlexPrice dashboard**
- You understand **what your product charges for**
  - Usage (API calls, transactions)
  - Limits (users, storage)
  - Access (modules, premium tools)

---

## Feature Creation Flow

1. Identify what is being consumed
2. Define how it is measured
3. Configure how usage is calculated
4. Save the feature for plan association

Each step depends on the previous one and must be completed in order.
