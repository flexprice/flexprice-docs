title: "Reservation/ Commitment Discount"
description: "Set minimum commitment, overage pricing when usage exceeds it, and optional true-up or per-window (hour/day) commitment."
---

## Overview

### What is Commitment?

Reservation discount (or commitment discount) lets you set a minimum commitment for usage, charge a premium for usage above that commitment (overage), and optionally enforce the minimum with true-up. You can use amount-based or quantity-based commitments, and apply them per billing period or per time window (hourly, daily).


## How it Works

For each billing period (or per window, if configured), FlexPrice compares actual usage to the commitment. Usage up to the commitment is charged at the reserved (discount) rate. Usage above the commitment is charged at **unit price × overage factor**. If usage is below the commitment and true-up is enabled, FlexPrice charges the full commitment amount; if true-up is disabled, only actual usage is charged.

### Example: Cloud provider

- A cloud company rents GPU/CPU capacity for inference or model deployment.
- Customers commit to minimum usage (e.g. $X/month or N GPU-hours/day). Usage above that is charged at a premium (**overage**); usage below can still be charged the full commitment (**true-up**).
- In FlexPrice, set reservation discount per product or charge: commitment amount, overage rate, and true-up on or off.

For more on commitment, overage, and true-up, see [Commitment](/docs/subscriptions/commitment).

### Billing Calculation Logic

**When usage ≥ commitment:**  
Total = commitment amount + (amount above commitment × overage factor).  
Overage is charged at **unit price × overage factor** for the extra usage.

**When usage < commitment and true-up enabled:**  
Total = full commitment amount (customer pays the minimum).

**When usage < commitment and true-up disabled:**  
Total = actual usage cost only.



## Steps to Configure Reservation Discount

Using the cloud provider example (e.g. Cloud Nova): customers commit to a minimum (e.g. 1,000/month for GPU usage or 500 GPU-hours at 2/hour). Follow these steps to configure the same in FlexPrice.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create subscription and select plan">
    Go to Customers → Select Customer → Add Subscription and choose the plan that includes the charge you want (e.g. GPU hours or inference API).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the charge for commitment">
    In the commitment section, select the charge to apply reservation discount to (e.g. GPU hours, CPU capacity, or data transfer).

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set commitment amount or quantity">
    Set Commitment type to Amount (e.g. 3,000/month) or Quantity (e.g. 500 GPU-hours) and enter the value. For the cloud example, 3,000/month gives customers the reserved rate up to that amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set overage factor">
    Enter the multiplier for usage above the commitment (e.g. 2.0 for 50% premium). Usage beyond the commitment (e.g. beyond 1,000) is then charged at unit price × 2.0.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable true-up and/or window (optional)">
    True-up: enable if the customer should pay the full commitment even when usage is below it (e.g. pay 1,000 even if they use 800 of GPU). Window commitment: enable for per-hour or per-day commitment (e.g. 100/hour or 20 GPU-hours/day) instead of one amount per billing period.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Configuration Options

<Steps>
  <Step title="Commitment Type">

    - **Amount-based:** Commitment in currency (e.g. 3,000/month). Overage and true-up apply to the amount.
    
    ### Example : Amount-Based Commitment with Overage

**Configuration:**
- Line Item: API Usage (metered)
- Commitment Type: Amount
- Commitment Amount: $3,000
- Overage Factor: 2.0x
- True-Up: Enabled

**Scenario A - Usage Exceeds Commitment:**
```
Actual Usage Cost: $3,500
Commitment: $3,000
Overage: $3,500 - $3,000 = $500
Overage Charge: $500 × 2.0 = $1000

Total Charge: $3,000 + $1000 = $4000
```

**Scenario B - Usage Below Commitment:**
```
Actual Usage Cost: $800
Commitment: $3,000
True-Up: Disabled

Total Charge: $800 (pay only for actual usage)
```
---
- **Quantity-based:** Commitment in units (e.g. 2,000 Multitenancy/day). Overage factor applies to the price of extra units.

### Example : Quantity-Based Commitment with True-Up

<Frame>
  ![Select Line Item](/public/images/docs/Subscriptions/ReservationDiscount/quantity-based-commitment.png)
</Frame>

**Configuration:**
- Line Item: Data Transfer (metered at $0.10/GB)
- Commitment Type: Quantity
- Commitment Quantity: 5,000 GB (= $500 at $0.10/GB)
- Overage Factor: 2.0x
- True-Up: Enabled

**Scenario A - Usage Exceeds Commitment:**
```
Actual Usage: 7,000 GB
Usage Cost: 7,000 × $0.10 = $700
Commitment Amount: 5,000 × $0.10 = $500
Overage: $700 - $500 = $200
Overage Charge: $200 × 2.0 = $400

Total Charge: $500 + $400 = $900
```

**Scenario B - Usage Below Commitment:**
```
Actual Usage: 3,000 GB
Usage Cost: 3,000 × $0.10 = $300
Commitment Amount: $500
True-Up: Enabled
True-Up Fee: $500 - $300 = $200

Total Charge: $500 (commitment enforced via true-up)
```

---
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Overage Factor">
    Multiplier for usage beyond the commitment: **Standard (1.0)** = no premium; **Premium (&gt; 1.0)** = higher rate for excess (e.g. 1.5x = 50% premium); **Discount (&lt; 1.0)** = lower rate (less common).
    Example: 1.5x overage, 3,000 commitment, usage 1,500 → charge = 1,500 + (500 × 1.5) = 1,750.
  </Step>
  <Step title="True-Up">
    If enabled, customers pay the full commitment even when usage is below it; if disabled, they pay only for actual usage. For more details, see [Commitment](/docs/subscriptions/commitment).
  </Step>

</Steps>

  <Step title="Window Commitment">
  <Frame>
      ![Select Line Item](/public/images/docs/Subscriptions/ReservationDiscount/window-bucket.png)
    </Frame>
  <Note>
  Window Commitment is applied only on the **bucket** feature.
</Note>
    - **Per billing period (default):** One commitment for the whole cycle (e.g. 2,000 images per month).
    - **Per window:** Commitment and overage/true-up apply per window (e.g. per hour, per day). Options: minute, hour, day, week. Each window is calculated separately.
    Example (hourly, 1 unit/hour, overage 2×, true-up on): Hour 1 → 10 used, true-up to 16; Hour 2 → 16 used; Hour 3 → 18 used (16 base + 2 at 2×). Total = 16 + 16 + 20.
  
    ### Example : Window Commitment (Hourly)

**Configuration:**
- Line Item: Compute Credits
- Commitment Type: Amount
- Commitment Amount: $100 per hour
- Overage Factor: 1.5x
- True-Up: Enabled
- Window Commitment: Enabled (hourly)

**Billing Period with 3 Hours:**

**Hour 1:**
```
Usage: $150
Commitment: $100
Overage: $50
Overage Charge: $50 × 1.5 = $75
Hour 1 Charge: $100 + $75 = $175
```

**Hour 2:**
```
Usage: $80
Commitment: $100
True-Up: $100 - $80 = $20
Hour 2 Charge: $100 (commitment enforced)
```
  **Total Billing Period Charge: $175 + $100 + $250 = $525**

  </Step>



Use **reservation discount** when each feature has its own commitment and overage. For one overall minimum spend, see [Commitment](/docs/subscriptions/commitment).
