## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Commitment Type

- **Use Amount-Based** when:
  - Pricing is complex with tiers or packages
  - You want guaranteed dollar revenue
  - Quantities vary significantly

- **Use Quantity-Based** when:
  - Pricing is simple (per-unit)
  - Customers think in units not dollars
  - Easier to communicate and understand

### 2. Set Appropriate Overage Factors

- **1.0x**: No premium, encourages usage
- **1.2-1.5x**: Moderate premium, standard practice
- **2.0x+**: High premium, discourages overage

### 3. Consider True-Up Carefully

- **Enable** when:
  - Need guaranteed minimum revenue
  - Reserving capacity or resources
  - Customer agrees to minimum commitment

- **Disable** when:
  - Want flexible, usage-based billing
  - Customer preference for pay-as-you-go
  - Building usage over time

### 4. Window Commitments for Variable Workloads

- Ideal for services with:
  - Time-based pricing (hourly/daily)
  - Variable load patterns
  - Peak usage pricing

- Avoid for:
  - Stable, predictable usage
  - Monthly aggregation preferred
  - Complex customer communication needed

### 5. Document and Communicate

- Clearly explain commitment terms to customers
- Provide examples in contracts
- Show estimated billing scenarios
- Monitor and report usage vs commitment
