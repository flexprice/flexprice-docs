title: "Pause subscription"
---

There are scenarios where customers may need to temporarily **pause their subscription** instead of canceling it. This feature ensures they are not billed during inactivity while allowing for a seamless reactivation when needed. Common use cases include:

* **Seasonal Usage**: A customer only requires the service at certain times of the year.

* **Budget Constraints**: A temporary pause allows cost control without losing their setup.

* **Operational Downtime**: Businesses undergoing internal transitions can pause subscriptions until they resume operations.

* **Trial Extension**: Giving users extra time before fully committing to a plan.

With Flexprice, pausing a subscription **stops all billing for the selected period** while keeping the account intact.

**Steps to Pause a Subscription:**

* Select the customer whose subscription needs to be paused from Customers tab

* Under the Subscriptions section, find the active subscription.

* Click on the Options Menu (⋮) next to the subscription.

* A confirmation message will summarize the pause period.

* Click Schedule Pause to apply changes.

Once paused, the subscription status updates to **Paused**, and the customer will not be charged until the subscription resumes.

**Steps to Resume a Subscription:**

A paused subscription can either **automatically resume** after the scheduled pause period or can be **resumed manually** at any time before the scheduled resume date.

* Under **Subscriptions**, locate the paused subscription.

* Click on the **Options Menu (⋮)** next to the subscription.

* Select "Resume Subscription”

* A confirmation message appears, indicating that resuming will **restart the billing cycle**.

* Click **Yes, Resume** to reactivate the subscription.

Once resumed, billing will continue based on the subscription’s original schedule.

**Points to consider:**

* Billing automatically resumes once the pause period ends unless manually resumed earlier.

* For usage-based subscriptions, any usage before pausing will still be billed.

* Customers using advance payment plans will be charged immediately upon resuming the subscription.
