## Overview

### What is wallet conversion rate?

**Wallet conversion rate** tells you how much money one credit is worth in your wallet's currency.

- The wallet **stores** balance in **credits** only. Currency is used only for **calculation and display**. Formula: **amount in currency = credits × conversion rate**.
- **Example:** Conversion rate **0.01**, wallet in USD. Then 1 credit = 0.01 USD. So 100 credits = 1 USD, and 1000 credits show as a 10 USD balance.
- You can set **two** rates on a wallet:
  - **Conversion rate** — used when you **spend** (debit) and when balance is shown in currency.
  - **Top-up conversion rate** — used only when you **add** credits (top-up). If you don’t set it, top-ups use conversion rate.

### What is conversion rate?

It is the number that links your unit to base currency. It appears in **three** places:

| Where | Field | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Price unit** | `conversion_rate` | Turns price unit amounts into base currency for billing. Formula: `price_unit_amount × conversion_rate = base_currency_amount`. |
| **Wallet** | `conversion_rate` | Links stored credits to currency (for display and when user spends). Wallet stores balance in **credits**; currency is worked out from this. Formula: `amount in currency = credits × conversion_rate`. Default: `"1"`. |
| **Wallet** | `topup_conversion_rate` | Same formula; used **only for top-ups**. If you do not set it, the wallet uses `conversion_rate` for top-ups. |

So: **1 credit = conversion_rate in currency.** Examples: rate 1 → 1 USD = 1 credit; rate 2 → 1 USD = 0.5 credits; rate 0.5 → 1 USD = 2 credits.

### Why it exists

<Steps>
  <Step title="Single base currency for billing">
    Bill and store in one base currency while pricing and displaying in credits (or another unit).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional separate top-up rate">
  Use a different rate for top-ups so you can give credits at a discount (more credits per dollar) or the opposite (fewer credits per dollar). Debits and balance still use one conversion rate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Relationship with base currency and price unit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Base currency">
    The fiat currency (e.g. `usd`) used for storage and invoicing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price unit">
    A custom unit with `conversion_rate` and `base_currency`; reused in plans, prices, and wallets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet created with price unit">
    The wallet’s `currency` and `conversion_rate` are set from that price unit; any `conversion_rate` in the create-wallet body is **ignored**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## How it works internally

- **Price unit:** Has `base_currency` and `conversion_rate`. Billing converts price unit amounts into that base currency for invoicing.
- **Wallet:** Balance is stored in **credits**. To show it in currency: amount = credits × conversion rate.

### When conversion is used

<Steps>
  <Step title="Price unit to base currency (billing)">
    Price unit’s `conversion_rate` is used when applying prices and building invoice line items.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet top-up (amount to credits)">
    Uses `topup_conversion_rate` (or `conversion_rate` if not set). If you send `amount` and not `credits_to_add`, credits = amount ÷ rate. If both are sent, **credits_to_add** wins and amount is ignored.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet debit (currency to credits)">
    Uses `conversion_rate` (e.g. invoice payment). Manual debit uses `credits` directly; no conversion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Balance in currency">
    Uses conversion_rate: currency = credits × rate; credits = currency ÷ rate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conversion during credit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Which rate">
    Top-up uses **topup_conversion_rate**. If not set, it uses **conversion_rate**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Top-up by amount">
    Send `amount` (in wallet currency). System works out `credits_to_add = amount ÷ topup_conversion_rate` and adds that many credits to the wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Top-up by credits">
    Send `credits_to_add`. That many credits are added to the wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Example">
    Wallet in USD, conversion rate (1 credit = 2 USD). Top-up with amount 10 USD → credits added = 10 ÷ 2 = 5. Wallet balance goes up by 5 credits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Conversion during debit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Which rate">
    Debits use **conversion_rate**. Not the top-up rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invoice payment">
    Amount in currency is turned into credits: `credits = amount ÷ conversion_rate`. That many credits are taken out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual debit">
    Send `credits`. No conversion. That many credits are taken out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Example">
    Same wallet (rate 2). Debit 5 credits → 10 USD worth taken out (5 × 2 = 10).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### Set conversion rate on a price unit (dashboard)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Price Units">
    Go to **Product Catalog** → **Price Units** → **Add** (or **Create Price Unit**).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter conversion rate and base currency">
    Enter **Conversion rate** and **Base currency** (required). Example: 100 units = 1 USD → use conversion rate **0.01**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Set conversion rate on a wallet (dashboard)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the customer">
    Go to **Customers** → select the customer → **Wallets** tab.
    <Frame>
  ![Create Price Unit](/public/images/docs/Product%20catalogue/custom-pricing/conversion_rate_create_wallet.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create wallet">
    Click **Create Wallet** (or **+ Add**). For **Custom** currency, select a price unit — **Currency** and **Conversion rate** are set from that unit. For fiat, enter **Conversion rate** and optionally **Top-up conversion rate**.
     <Frame>
  ![Create Price Unit](/public/images/docs/Product%20catalogue/custom-pricing/conversion-rate-transaction.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Set conversion rate via API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create price unit">
    `POST /v1/prices/units` — body includes `conversion_rate`, `base_currency`, `name`, `code`, `symbol`. See [Create a new price unit](/api-reference/price-units/create-a-new-price-unit).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create wallet">
    `POST /v1/wallets` — send `currency` (required), `conversion_rate` (optional, default `"1"`), `topup_conversion_rate` (optional), or `price_unit` (then currency and conversion_rate come from the price unit).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Top-up wallet">
    `POST /v1/wallets/{id}/top-up` — send `amount` (converted with top-up rate) or `credits_to_add`; if both, credits are used.
  </Step>
</Steps>


### Validation

- **Price unit:** `conversion_rate` is required and must be &gt; 0.
- **Wallet:** `conversion_rate` defaults to `"1"`. If you set it, it must be &gt; 0. `topup_conversion_rate` must be &gt; 0 if you set it. When you use `price_unit`, that price unit must be Active.

### Example requests

**Create price unit** (100 units = 1 USD):

```json
{
  "name": "Credits",
  "code": "CRD",
  "symbol": "¢",
  "base_currency": "usd",
  "conversion_rate": "0.01"
}
```

**Create wallet with price unit** (rate from price unit):

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cust_xxx",
  "price_unit": "CRD",
  "currency": "usd"
}
```

**Create wallet with explicit rates:**

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cust_xxx",
  "currency": "usd",
  "conversion_rate": "0.01",
  "topup_conversion_rate": "0.01"
}
```

**Top-up by amount** (uses top-up rate):

```json
{
  "amount": "10.00",
  "transaction_reason": "PURCHASED_CREDIT",
  "idempotency_key": "topup-uniq-123"
}
```

## Use cases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Show credits, bill in USD">
    Show and charge in credits. Invoice in one currency (e.g. USD).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Promotional top-up">
    Set `topup_conversion_rate` so users get more credits per 1 USD. `conversion_rate` is still used for spending and for showing balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Edge cases

| Case | What happens |
|------|------------------|
| **Missing or zero rate** | Price unit: request fails. Wallet: `conversion_rate` can default to `"1"`. Best: send a valid rate or use `price_unit`. |
| **Invalid or negative rate** | Request fails. Rate must be &gt; 0. |
| **Rate change** | Wallet balance is in credits. Changing the rate only changes how much currency is shown. New top-ups and debits use the new rate. |
| **Top-up: amount and credits both sent** | **credits_to_add** is used. **amount** is ignored. |
| **Wallet with price_unit** | `conversion_rate` in the request is ignored. Currency and rate come from the price unit. |

---

## Examples

<Steps>
  <Step title="Price unit">
    `conversion_rate = "0.01"`, `base_currency = "usd"`. So 100 CRD = 1.00 USD. A charge of 50 CRD becomes 0.50 USD in billing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet">
    `conversion_rate = "0.01"`. So 1 credit = 0.01 USD. Top-up 10 USD (same top-up rate) adds 1000 credits. Manual debit 500 credits takes out 5 USD worth.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Two rates (promo top-up)">
    `conversion_rate = "0.01"`, `topup_conversion_rate = "0.008"`. Normal spend: 1 credit = 0.01 USD. Top-up: 1 USD = 125 credits.
  </Step>
</Steps>
