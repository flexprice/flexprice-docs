Managing a wallet effectively requires adding credits regularly. Flexprice provides two ways to do this: manual top-up and automatic top-up.

Manual top-ups give you as well as your customers control over when and how much they add, while automatic top-ups ensure uninterrupted billing by preventing a zero balance.

**Manual Top-Up**

Manual top-ups allow customers to add funds as needed, either as free credits (for promotions, compensations) or purchased credits (via payment methods).

* Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** on top right to top-up credits in an existing wallet

* Click Add and wallet will be topped-up successfully.

**Enabling Auto Top-Up**


For businesses handling high-volume transactions, automatic top-up eliminates the need for manual monitoring. It ensures a wallet never runs out of balance by setting predefined conditions for recharging.

* While creating a wallet, Toggle **Recharge Wallet Automatically** to enable auto top-up.

* Set the trigger condition as **Balance falls below a certain amount** (e.g., $100).

* Define the **minimum balance threshold**.

* Enter the **top-up amount** (e.g., $100, $500, etc.).

* Click **Save Wallet**.

## Wallet Top-Up Types

There are 2 main types of wallet top-up for subscriptions:

### 1. Free Top-Up
Free credits are promotional or complimentary credits added directly to the wallet without requiring payment or invoice generation.

### 2. Purchased Top-Up
Purchased credits require payment and come in two variants:
- **Purchase top-up without invoice**: Credits are directly added to customer subscription and allow immediate access to credits
- **Purchase top-up with invoice**: User receives an invoice for wallet top-up payment
