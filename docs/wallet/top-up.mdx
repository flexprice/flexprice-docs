Wallet top-ups allow you to add credits to customer wallets, ensuring continuous service availability. Flexprice supports two top-up methods: **manual top-up** for on-demand credit additions and **automatic top-up** for maintaining minimum balance thresholds.

---

## Manual Top-Up

Manual top-ups provide flexibility to add credits on demand. You can issue free credits for promotions and compensations, or process purchased credits through standard payment methods.

### Adding Credits Manually

  <Step title="Confirm">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Top-Up

Automatic top-up ensures uninterrupted service by automatically recharging wallets when they fall below a specified threshold. This eliminates manual monitoring and prevents service disruptions due to insufficient balance.

### Configuring Auto Top-Up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auto Top-Up">
    During wallet creation, toggle **Recharge Wallet Automatically**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Trigger Threshold">
    Define when auto top-up should activate (e.g., when balance falls below $100)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Minimum Balance">
    Enter the minimum balance threshold that triggers automatic recharge
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Top-Up Amount">
    Specify the amount to add when auto top-up is triggered (e.g., $100, $500)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save changes** to activate auto top-up
  </Step>

---

## Purchased Credit Top-Up (with Invoice)

The invoice-based top-up workflow provides comprehensive payment tracking and record-keeping for credit purchases.

### How It Works

When you select **Purchased Credits** and enable **Generate Invoice**, Flexprice initiates the following flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Top-Up Initiated">
    You select **Purchased Credits** and enable **Generate Invoice** in the top-up dialog, then click **Add Credits**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Invoice Created">
    An invoice is automatically generated and finalized with payment status `Pending`. The invoice contains the credit purchase details and is visible in your invoice list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Transaction Logged">
    A wallet transaction is created with status `pending` and transaction reason `PURCHASED_CREDIT_INVOICED`. The transaction is linked to the generated invoice
      <Frame>
      ![Screenshot 2025-03-12 at 6.20.01 PM.png](/public/images/docs/Wallet/Top-up%20wallet/transaction-before.png)
      </Frame>  
  </Step>

      

  <Step title="Credits Hold">
    Credits remain unavailable and are not added to the wallet balance. The wallet balance remains unchanged until payment is confirmed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Record Payment">
      Credits get available only after the payment is followed through. When the invoice payment status becomes `Succeeded`, the wallet balance gets topped-up.

      <Frame>
      ![Screenshot 2025-03-12 at 6.20.01 PM.png](/public/images/docs/Wallet/Top-up%20wallet/record-payment.png)
      </Frame> 

You can either `Record Payment` or `Update Payment Status` directly to confirm payment.    
    - **Record Payment** - A payment record is created for the invoice supporting tracking and reconciliation. Payment can be recorded through following methods:
      - **Offline Payment** - Record payment that was processed outside the system.
      - **Payment Link** - Generate a payment link for online payment. Payment status gets updated when payment is successfully processed through the payment gateway. If you want to know more about the `payment_link` behavior, check out [Stripe Payment Link & Checkout](/integrations/stripe/payment-links) for configuration instructions.

      </Frame>
    - **Update Payment Status** - Invoice payment status changes from `Pending` to `SUCCEEDED` for API responses)
      After the payment is completed, the invoice status is updated to confirm successful payment.
  </Step>

  
  <Step title="Credits Available">
    Once payment is confirmed and the invoice is marked as paid:
    - Transaction status changes from `pending` to `completed`
    - Credits are immediately added to the customer's wallet
    - Wallet balance is updated and credits become available for use

  </Step>

     
  </Steps>

  For complete transaction lifecycle details, check out [Purchased Credits (Invoiced)](/docs/wallet/transactions#purchased-credits-invoiced) in the Wallet Transactions documentation.

  ### Recording Payments

  After generating an invoice, you must record payment before credits are added to the wallet.

  #### Payment Methods

  **Offline Payment**
  Record payments received outside the platform, such as bank transfers, checks, or cash payments. Manually mark the invoice as paid after confirming receipt.

  **Payment Link**
  Generate secure payment links for online transactions. Supports multiple payment gateways including Stripe. Invoice status updates automatically upon successful payment. For detailed payment link behavior, check out [Strip Payment Links checkout Flow](/integrations/stripe/payment-links).

  <Warning>
    **Payment Gateway Required** — Payment recording requires a configured payment gateway. For Example, Refer to [Stripe Connection Setup](/integrations/stripe/connection-setup) for configuration instructions.
  </Warning>

### Credit Activation

Once payment is recorded and the invoice is marked as paid:
- Credits are immediately added to the customer's wallet
- Transaction status updates to `completed` in wallet history
- Credits become available for immediate use
