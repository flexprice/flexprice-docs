Managing a wallet effectively requires adding credits regularly. Flexprice provides two ways to do this: **manual top-up** and **automatic top-up**.

Manual top-ups give you and your customers control over when and how much to add, while automatic top-ups ensure uninterrupted billing by preventing a zero balance.

## Manual Top-Up

Manual top-ups allow you to add funds as needed, either as free credits (for promotions or compensations) or purchased credits (via payment methods).

  <Step title="Set Top-Up Amount">
