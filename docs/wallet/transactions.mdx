## Overview

Every action that affects a wallet balance is recorded as a transaction. The **Transactions** section provides a complete audit trail of all wallet activity, making it easy to track credits, debits, and monitor account balances.

## Transaction Types

Wallet transactions fall into three main categories based on how they affect the wallet balance:

### Free Credits Added

<Frame>
  ![Free Credits Transaction](/public/images/docs/Wallet/transactions/free-credits-added.png)
</Frame>

Promotional or complimentary credits added directly to the wallet:

**Characteristics:**
- Credits are immediately available for use
- Balance updates instantly
- No payment or invoice required
- Reflected with a positive amount (e.g., +100 $)

**Common Use Cases:**
- Welcome bonuses for new customers
- Promotional campaigns
- Service compensation
- Customer loyalty rewards
- Trial credits

**Example**: You add $100 in free credits as a welcome bonus for a new customer. The credits are immediately available, and the customer can start using them right away.

### Purchased Credits (Invoiced)

<Frame>
  ![Free Credits Transaction](/public/images/docs/Wallet/transactions/purchased-credits-invoiced.png)
</Frame>

Credits purchased by the customer that are linked to an invoice:

**Characteristics:**
- Transaction remains in **pending state** until invoice is paid
- Balance is **not updated** while pending
- Credits become available only after invoice payment
- Reflected with a positive amount (e.g., +20 $)

**Payment Flow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase Initiated">
    Customer purchases credits and transaction is created in pending state
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Invoice Generated">
    An invoice is automatically created for the purchased amount
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Pending">
    Transaction remains pending while waiting for invoice payment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Received">
    When the invoice is paid, transaction status updates to completed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Credits Available">
    Wallet balance is updated and credits become available for use
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Common Use Cases:**
- Enterprise customers with NET payment terms
- Credit packages sold with invoicing
- Prepaid purchases requiring payment confirmation
- Customers who prefer invoiced billing

**Example**: A customer purchases 500 credits worth $500. The transaction shows as "Purchased Credits (Invoiced)" and remains pending. Once the customer pays the invoice, the transaction completes and the credits are added to their wallet balance.

<Note>
  **Pending State**: While a purchased credit transaction is pending, the wallet balance remains unchanged. This ensures credits are only added after payment confirmation.
</Note>

#### Auto-Complete Purchased Credit Transactions

For automated payment flows, you can enable the `AutoCompletePurchasedCreditTransaction` setting for your account. When enabled:

- Purchased credit transactions are created directly as **completed** instead of pending
- Credits are added to the wallet **immediately** upon transaction creation
- Invoice is still generated but marked as paid automatically
- Useful for automated payment systems where payment is guaranteed

**When to Enable:**
- Integration with pre-authorized payment methods
- Automated billing systems with payment confirmation
- Trust-based credit purchases for verified enterprise customers

**Note**: This setting bypasses the pending state entirely. Only enable if you have a reliable payment confirmation mechanism in place.

### Debited

<Frame>

</Frame>

Credits deducted from the wallet for usage, payments, or manual adjustments:

**Characteristics:**
- Credits are immediately removed from wallet
- Balance updates instantly
- Reflected with a negative amount (e.g., -30 $)
- Cannot be reversed once completed

**Common Use Cases:**
- Feature usage charges (API calls, storage, etc.)
- Subscription fees paid from wallet
- Invoice payments using wallet credits
- Manual balance adjustments by admins
- Service consumption

**Example**: A customer uses 30 credits during the billing period for API calls. The wallet is debited by 30 credits, reducing their available balance.

## Transaction Details

Each transaction record in the Transactions section includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Transactions** | Type and description of the transaction |
| **Payment Date** | Date when the transaction was created or completed |
| **Expiry Date** | When credits expire (if applicable, otherwise shown as `--`) |
| **Priority** | Processing priority for credit consumption (shown as `--` if not set) |
| **Amount** | Transaction amount in currency and credits |

### Understanding Transaction Amounts

Transaction amounts are displayed in two formats:

- **Currency Amount**: Dollar value (e.g., +100, -30)
- **Credit Amount**: Credit units (e.g., +100 credits, -30 credits)

**Positive amounts** (+) indicate credits **added** to the wallet  
**Negative amounts** (-) indicate credits **removed** from the wallet

### Pending Transactions
