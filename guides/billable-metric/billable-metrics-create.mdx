* At the top-right of the **Billable Metrics** dashboard, select **Add Meter** to create a new Billable Metric.

* **Define Event Schema**
  ![](/Screenshot2025-01-20at11.13.29PM.png)

  * **Event Name**

    * This is the **unique identifier** you’ll use to send events that match the metric.

    * Keep it **short and descriptive**—for example, `tokens_used` or `orders_placed`.

    * Must be unique across your Flexprice account to avoid confusion with other metrics.

  * **Display Name**:

    * It is a **user-friendly label** (e.g., “Tokens Used” or “Orders Placed”) that will appear on invoices, internal dashboards, and usage reports.

  * This helps you and your team instantly recognize what the metric measures—especially handy if you have several metrics.

**Example**
Suppose you want to track how many tokens users consume while calling your AI model. In that case:

* **Event Name**: `tokens_used`

* **Display Name**: `Tokens Used`

1. **Event Filters** *(Optional)*&#x20;
   ![](/Screenshot2025-01-20at11.25.02PM.png)
   Filters let you **narrow down** which events get counted or summed in this metric. You **do not** have to add filters if you want to aggregate **all** events of a given type. However, filters become crucial if you need more granular control, such as **billing for only certain AI models** or **distinguishing usage by environment**.

   * **Key & Values**

     * A filter consists of a **property key** (e.g., `model`) and **one or more values** (e.g., `llama3.1`, `llama3.2`).

     * Only events that match *both* the key and one of the values are included in the metric.

It is important to note that filters cannot be edited later, so decide up front if you’ll need them for billing or reporting.

**Example**
Continuing our AI tokens example:
If your system supports multiple AI models (`llama3.1`, `llama3.2`, `alpaca2.0`), and you only want to track usage from **Llama** models for specialized billing, you can add a filter:

* **Key**: `model`

* **Values**: `llama3.1`, `llama3.2`

This means Flexprice will only aggregate token usage events where `model` is either `llama3.1` or `llama3.2`.

1. **Define Aggregation**
   The **aggregation** settings tell Flexprice **how** to measure your events.

   * **Aggregation**

     * Flexprice supports 8 aggregation types (see [Aggregation Overview](/docs/Product%20catalogue/Features/Aggregation/Overview) for detailed explanations):

     * **COUNT**: Counts the total number of matching events, regardless of any numeric value in the event data.

     * **SUM**: Adds a numeric property (like tokens, price, etc.) across all matching events.

     * **AVERAGE**: Calculates the mean value of a specified property across all matching events.

     * **COUNT UNIQUE**: Counts only the unique values of a specified event property.

     * **LATEST**: Returns the most recent value of a specified property based on event timestamp.

     * **SUM WITH MULTIPLIER**: Sums a property and applies a configurable multiplier for rate conversions.

     * **MAX**: Returns the maximum value of a specified property (supports bucketed calculations).

     * **WEIGHTED SUM**: Time-weighted sum for capacity-based billing where values are prorated by duration.

   * **Aggregation Value**

     * The **property** that Flexprice aggregates. Required for all aggregation functions except `COUNT`.

     * For numeric aggregations (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `SUM WITH MULTIPLIER`, `MAX`, `WEIGHTED SUM`): specify a numeric property (e.g., `tokens`, `gb`, `response_time`).

     * For `COUNT UNIQUE`: specify any property whose distinct values you want to count (e.g., `user_id`, `session_id`).

     * For `LATEST`: specify the property whose most recent value you want to track (e.g., `tier_level`, `status`).

     * For `COUNT`: no field required (counts event occurrences only).

   * **Aggregation Type**

     * **Cumulative**: The meter never resets. Usage keeps accumulating across billing cycles, providing a running total. This is useful for features like storage.

     * **Periodic**: Usage resets at each **billing period** (e.g., monthly). This is ideal for most subscription-based models where usage is calculated anew every cycle

**Example**
If you’re summing the total tokens used:

* **Aggregation** = `SUM`

* **Aggregation Value** = `tokens`

* **Aggregation Type** = `Periodic` (if you invoice monthly and want usage to reset each month)

**Save the Meter**

* Click **Save Meter** to finalize your settings.

* The Billable Metric becomes **Active** and appears on the dashboard.

You can now **send events** matching this **Event Name** (and any defined filters) to Flexprice. The system will immediately begin **aggregating** usage for billing and reporting.
