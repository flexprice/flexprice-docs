3. **Save Changes**

   * Click **Save** to confirm your updates.

   * The changes take effect immediately for all future events, though historical data is still preserved as originally tracked.

*If you need a substantially different Event Name or filters, consider creating a new Billable Metric instead of editing an existing one.*
