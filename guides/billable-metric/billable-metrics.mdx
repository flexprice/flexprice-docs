Billable Metrics allow you to define **how events are measured and aggregated** for billing purposes. They specify:

* Which events you track (e.g., token usage, orders placed)

* How to measure them (e.g., summing numeric fields, counting occurrences)

* Whether to apply filters (e.g., only certain AI models or environments)

By setting up Billable Metrics, you ensure that every relevant usage event is captured and calculated correctlyâ€”forming the backbone for **accurate invoicing**, **usage analysis**, and **flexible pricing plans**.![](/billable-metric-dashboard.png)
