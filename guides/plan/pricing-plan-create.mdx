### Setting-up a recurring-based charge:

Select subscription type as Recurring to charge your customers a recurring fee based on the defined billing period. Whenever user purchases this plan, it will be charged a flat fee and given access to the features that will be part of that plan.

* **Select billing currency**
  We currently support 2 currencies which includes:

  * INR (Indian Rupees)

  * USD (United States Dollars)

* **Choose a billable period**
  The plan interval corresponds to the billing period and defines when invoices are generated. There are several plan intervals:

  * **Weekly**: subscription fees and charges are billed on a weekly basis (Monday to Sunday);

  * **Monthly**: subscription fees and charges are billed on a monthly basis;

  * **Quarterly**: subscription fees and charges are billed on a quarterly basis (every 3 months); and

  * **Yearly**: subscription fees are billed on a yearly basis and charges can be billed monthly or annually.

* Add relevant price you want to charge your customer based on the selected billing period and then click on **Add** button.

### Setting-up a usage-based charge:

To incorporate usage-based charges into a plan, you can utilize existing billable metrics. This enables you to offer “pay-as-you-go” features. For instance, you can create charges based on the number of API calls, the number of active users, transactions, compute time, etc.

* Select the billable metric on which you've created earlier.&#x20;

* Define relevant currency and billing period for your plan

* Select the pricing model.
  Flexprice currently support 3 types of pricing models:

*

  * **Flat fee**
    Select the Flat fee pricing model if you want to charge the **same price for each unit** consumed.&#x20;
    **Example:** $0.01 per API call.

    **Example:** $5 per 100 API calls.

    Select the volume charge model if you want to define several price tiers but want to apply a **single unit price based on the total volume**. You can also apply a **flat fee** in addition to the unit price.

  * **Example:**- 0 – 10,000 calls → $0.001 per call

    * 10,001 – ∞ calls → $0.0008 per call
