### **Managing Multiple Subscriptions for a Customer**

* A single customer can have multiple active subscriptions.

* Each subscription operates independently based on its assigned billing period, charges, and start date.

* For example, a customer can have both a `Basic Plan` and an `Addon: AI Agent Sessions` subscription, each billed separately.
