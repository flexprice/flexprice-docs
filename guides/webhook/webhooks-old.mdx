# Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about events that occur in your Flexprice account. Each time an event is generated, Flexprice sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook endpoints you've configured, containing information about the event.

## Setting Up Webhooks

To set up a webhook endpoint:

1. Go to the **Developers** section in the Flexprice dashboard
2. Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab
3. Click **Add a webhook**
4. Enter your webhook URL
5. Choose your preferred webhook signature method
6. Click **Add webhook** to confirm

You can add multiple webhook endpoints to receive notifications at different URLs.

## Webhook Format

All webhook events follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "webhook_type": "event.name",
  "object_type": "object_type",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      // Object details specific to the event type
    }
  }
}
```

## Webhook Signature

Webhook requests include a signature in the headers to verify that the request came from Flexprice. You can use this signature to validate the authenticity of the webhook request.

## Webhook Events

Below is a comprehensive list of webhook events that Flexprice can send to your application.


### Customer Events

## Handling Webhook Events

Your webhook endpoint should:

1. Respond with a 2xx status code (200, 201, 202, or 204) to acknowledge receipt
2. Process the event asynchronously if needed
3. Be idempotent (able to handle the same event multiple times without issues)

## Error Handling and Retries

If your endpoint fails to respond with a 2xx status code, Flexprice will retry sending the webhook several times with an exponential backoff. You can view failed webhook deliveries and manually retry them from the Flexprice dashboard.

## Webhook Logs

You can view the history of webhook events sent to your endpoints:

1. Go to the **Developers** section in the Flexprice dashboard
2. Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab
3. Click on a webhook endpoint to view its event history
4. Click on an event to see its details, including the payload and response

This helps you debug issues with webhook delivery and ensure your application is correctly processing events.
