## Overview

A Nomod connection in Flexprice lets you:

- **Sync customers** from Flexprice to Nomod
- **Sync invoices** from Flexprice to Nomod
- **Create payment links** for invoices so customers can pay via Nomod
- **Receive payment** (e.g. link paid, invoice paid) in Flexprice
- **Process payments** through Nomod’s secure checkout

## Prerequisites

Before you start, have:

1. **Nomod account** – [Nomod app](https://nomod.com) ([Play Store](https://nomod.app/g) / [App Store](https://nomod.app/a))
3. **Flexprice account** – https://flexprice.io/

## Keys you need

| Key | Where to get it | What it’s for |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| **Nomod API key** | Nomod app → **Connect and Manage Integrations** | Payment links, invoices, and Nomod integration in Flexprice |
| **Zapier API key** | Nomod app - **Settings** → **Business** → **Connect apps and manage keys** → **Zapier**  | Contact Flexprice team to set up the Zapier Zap and webhook configuration |

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

1. **Environment Separation**: Use different keys for test/production
2. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your Nomod API keys
3. **Access Control**: Limit API key permissions in Nomod
4. **Encryption**: All credentials are encrypted at rest in Flexprice

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Connection creation fails | Invalid Nomod API key | Verify key in Nomod app → Connect and Manage Integrations |
| Events not reaching Flexprice | Invalid or missing Zapier API key | Verify Zapier API key in the connection; Flexprice uses it for webhook integration |
| Invoice sync fails | Sync not enabled | Enable invoice outbound sync in the connection |

## Next steps

After your Nomod connection is set up:

1. **Test payment links** – Create a test payment link and confirm the flow works.
2. **Check events** – Ensure your Zapier API key is correct and events reach Flexprice (Flexprice handles the Zapier integration).
3. **Enable invoice sync** – If you want invoices pushed to Nomod, turn on **Push to Nomod** in the connection.
4. **Go live** – When ready, switch to production keys in Nomod and Flexprice.
