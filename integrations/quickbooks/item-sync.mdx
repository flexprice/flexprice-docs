description: 'Learn how Flexprice automatically creates and manages items in QuickBooks for invoice line items'

## Overview

When syncing invoices from Flexprice to QuickBooks, each invoice line item must reference a QuickBooks **Item** (product or service). Flexprice automatically handles item creation and management, ensuring your line items are properly tracked in QuickBooks.

**Key Points**:
- Items are synced when QuickBooks connection is active
- Each Flexprice price is mapped to a QuickBooks service item
- Items are linked to your configured Income Account
- Item mappings are stored to prevent duplicates

### When Items Are Created

Items are created automatically when:
1. **New Price**: A Flexprice price hasn't been synced to QuickBooks before
2. **Active Connection**: QuickBooks connection is active and authenticated

### Why Service Items?

QuickBooks has different item types (Inventory, Non-Inventory, Service). Flexprice uses **Service** items because:
- ✅ Best fit for SaaS and subscription businesses
- ✅ No inventory tracking required
- ✅ Simplifies accounting for digital services
- ✅ Requires only Income Account (no COGS account)

## Entity Integration Mapping

### Mapping Structure

When an item is created, Flexprice stores a mapping record:

```json
{
  "entity_id": "price_01ABC123",
  "entity_type": "price",
  "provider_type": "quickbooks",
  "provider_entity_id": "125",
  "metadata": {
    "synced_at": "2025-11-25T09:50:21Z",
    "quickbooks_item_name": "Pro Plan-API Calls"
  }
}
```

### Why Mapping Matters

**Prevents Duplicates**:
- Before creating an item, Flexprice checks if mapping exists
- If found, uses existing QuickBooks item ID
- Avoids creating duplicate items for the same price

**Enables Sync**:
- Maps Flexprice prices to QuickBooks items
- Allows consistent line item references across invoices
- Maintains data integrity between systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Item creation fails | Missing Income Account | Configure Income Account ID in connection |
| Item creation fails | Invalid account ID | Verify Income Account exists and is active |
| Duplicate items created | Mapping not found | Check entity_integration_mapping table |


## Best Practices

### Income Account

💡 **Use a Dedicated Account**: Create a specific Income account like "Flexprice Revenue" for easy tracking

💡 **Keep Account Active**: Ensure the Income account is always active in QuickBooks

💡 **Document Account ID**: Store the account ID in your configuration documentation

### Item Management

💡 **Don't Manually Edit**: Avoid manually editing Flexprice-created items in QuickBooks

💡 **Use Consistent Naming**: Follow Flexprice naming conventions for clarity

💡 **Monitor Mappings**: Regularly check entity_integration_mapping for data integrity
