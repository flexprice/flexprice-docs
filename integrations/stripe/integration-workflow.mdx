## Step 2: Sync Configuration Details

### Plan Inbound Sync (Stripe → Flexprice)

- **What it does:** Automatically imports Stripe products as Flexprice plans
- **Webhook events used:**  
  `product.created`, `product.updated`, `product.deleted`
- When you enable **Plan Inbound Sync**:
  - Stripe products are imported as Flexprice plans
  - Plans will initially have **empty pricing structures**
  - You must manually add usage charges to imported plans
  - Usage charges can be rolled out to existing subscriptions

**Important:** Flexprice focuses on usage-based billing, so imported plans serve as containers for your usage pricing models.

#### 2.1 Adding Usage Charges to Plans

After importing plans from Stripe:

1. **Navigate to Plans** in Flexprice
2. **Select an imported plan**
3. **Add usage charges:**
   - Metered billing components
   - Tiered pricing structures
   - Per-unit charges

#### 2.2 Rolling Out Usage Charges

When you add or modify usage charges:

- Changes can be applied to **existing subscriptions**
- Set **effective dates** for pricing changes

### Subscription Inbound Sync (Stripe → Flexprice)

- **What it does:** Automatically imports Stripe subscriptions into Flexprice
- **When to enable:** Customers subscribe via Stripe and you want billing data managed in Flexprice
- **Webhook events used:**  
  `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`

#### 2.3 Subscription Upgrades and Downgrades

Flexprice handles subscription changes through a **cancel-and-recreate** process:

**The Process:**

1. Customer initiates upgrade/downgrade request on Stripe
2. Flexprice cancels the existing subscription internally
3. **Usage charges are calculated immediately** for the canceled period
4. If invoice outbound sync is enabled, usage invoice is sent to Stripe
5. New subscription is created with exact start and end dates
6. Customer receives confirmation of the change

**Benefits of this approach:**

- **Accurate usage billing** for partial periods
- **Clean subscription transitions**
- **Precise proration** handling
- **Audit trail** for all changes

#### 2.4 Subscription Cancellations

When a subscription is canceled:

1. **Immediate usage invoice generation** for the current period
2. **Conditional sync** to Stripe based on your settings
3. **Subscription marked as canceled** in both systems
4. **Final confirmation** sent to customer

**Key Features:**

- No usage charges are lost during cancellation
- Immediate billing for consumed resources
- Seamless integration with Stripe's payment collection

#### 2.5 Invoice Outbound Sync (Flexprice → Stripe)

- **What it does:** Sends invoices generated in Flexprice to Stripe for payment processing
- **When to enable:** You create invoices in Flexprice but want Stripe to handle payment collection
- **Benefits:** Unified payment experience and centralized transaction history

## Step 3: Payment Flow Setup

### 3.1 Supported Payment Methods

Flexprice supports multiple Stripe payment flows:

1. **Checkout Sessions** – For one-time payments via Stripe Checkout
2. **Saved Payment Methods** – Store customer cards for future billing
3. **Setup Intents** – Save payment methods without immediate charge

### 3.2 Payment Collection Modes

You can choose how customer payments are collected:

| Mode          | Description                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automatic** | Stripe automatically charges customers when invoices are due      |
| **Manual**    | Customers receive payment links to complete transactions manually |
